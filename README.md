## TFU Build Creed  

TFU lights are not hobby builds. They are field tools — hardened, trusted, and ready to deploy.  

**1. Thermal Path**  
No gaps, no shims.  
MCPCBs bonded flat with paste + adhesive — heat moves like water downhill.  
Copper used only as solid, lapped, glued mass.  

**2. Mechanical Integrity**  
No loose stacks. No “hope the pressure holds.”  
Drivers glued, threads Loctite’d, springs bypassed.  
Built to survive a drop, a ruck ride, or a jump out of a bird.  

**3. Electrical Reliability**  
Clean solder, secure joints, strain relief where it matters.  
Current delivery tested, not assumed.  
Mode groups chosen for work, not play.  

**4. Field Philosophy**  
If it can wiggle, it can fail. If it can fail, it’s not TFU.  
A TFU light should earn trust beside an IFAK and a multitool — not beside a desk toy.  
“No half measures” is the baseline.  

> TFU: From bench to field, hardened for work. Cool builds are fun. Trusted builds save your ass.
