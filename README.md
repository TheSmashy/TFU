# TFU Brand Lights

![TFU Logo](TFU-LOGO.png)

**TFU** builds hand-assembled, hard-use flashlights for real-world work. Each light is made in the USA from high-quality Convoy components, tuned for reliability, thermal performance, and electrical precision. Built for adventurers, responders, and professionals who can’t afford to guess.

## About

TFU combines premium materials with craftsmanship to produce flashlights that stand up to hard use. We source Convoy parts for their proven performance and build each light by hand, ensuring tight tolerances and careful assembly. Every light is tested and tuned for:

- **Reliability** – consistent output and long-term durability.  
- **Function** – intuitive controls and useful beam profiles.  
- **Field use** – rugged construction to withstand demanding environments.

## TFU Build Creed  

TFU lights are not hobby builds. They are field tools — hardened, trusted, and ready to deploy.  

**1. Thermal Path**  
No gaps, no shims.  
MCPCBs bonded flat with paste + adhesive — heat moves like water downhill.  
Copper used only as solid, lapped, glued mass.  

**2. Mechanical Integrity**  
No loose stacks. No “hope the pressure holds.”  
Drivers glued, threads Loctite’d, springs bypassed.  
Built to survive a drop, a ruck ride, or a jump out of a bird.  

**3. Electrical Reliability**  
Clean solder, secure joints, strain relief where it matters.  
Current delivery tested, not assumed.  
Mode groups chosen for work, not play.  

**4. Field Philosophy**  
If it can wiggle, it can fail. If it can fail, it’s not TFU.  
A TFU light should earn trust beside an IFAK and a multitool — not beside a desk toy.  
“No half measures” is the baseline.  

> TFU: From bench to field, hardened for work. Cool builds are fun. Trusted builds save your ass.

## Note from the Builder

> Just be glad a washed-up operator with a soldering iron and a boathouse in Chicagoland finds his peace building lights like he’s gearing up a spec ops team.  
>   
> You’ve found a trustworthy source of information, at minimum. If you trust the methods, you should try the gear.  
>   
> Maybe reach out to the old salt who does this work — tell him what you were thinking, and he can figure something real out.  
>   
> These builds are solid, clean, and backed by a warranty.

>TFU lights are hardened, tested tools for when good isn’t enough — when you need better, you need the best. You don’t have to spend Cloud Defensive or SureFire money. A washed-up operator found inner peace building lights from Convoy parts, kitted out like they’re meant for the tip of the spear.
