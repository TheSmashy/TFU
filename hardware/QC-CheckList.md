# TFU Quality Control Checklist  
_For TFU-E, TFU-F, TFU-T series — standardized inspection before serial assignment and packaging._

---

# **QC-1 — Mechanical / Structural Integrity**

## **Tailcap**
- [ ] Tailcap machining visually symmetrical  
- [ ] Switch boot centered in tail well (no lateral tilt)  
- [ ] Retaining ring fully seated and torqued evenly  
- [ ] Switch travel smooth, no “sided” mushiness  
- [ ] No rattle when shaken  
- [ ] Threads inspected for burrs, grit, or anodizing chips  
- [ ] Threads lightly lubed with silicone grease  

## **Clip + Fasteners**
- [ ] Clip curvature matches tail geometry  
- [ ] Clip legs sit flush (no daylight under legs)  
- [ ] Screw spacing aligns correctly with tailcap holes  
- [ ] Screws torqued to matched depth  
- [ ] No clip wobble or shifting under thumb pressure  
- [ ] Clip does not interfere with switch boot travel  
- [ ] Clip does not scrape tailcap edges when flexed  

## **Tube + Head**
- [ ] Tube threads smooth, no cross-thread marks  
- [ ] Inner tube spring centered and secure (if present)  
- [ ] No sharp edges or anodizing defects  
- [ ] Head seats fully with no gap or rocking  
- [ ] O-rings present, undamaged, and properly greased

# **QC-2 — Optical Performance**

## **Emitter Alignment**
- [ ] LED properly centered under optic/reflector  
- [ ] No dark rings / donut at 1–2m  
- [ ] No sideways tint shift from optic tilt  
- [ ] MCPCB fully seated flat on emitter shelf  

## **Optic / Reflector**
- [ ] TIR sits flush, no rocking  
- [ ] Centering gasket correct height, not pinched  
- [ ] Lens interior free of dust, fibers, or fingerprints  
- [ ] AR glass installed correctly (if used)  
- [ ] Bezel tightened fully with no gap  

## **Beamshots**
Perform beam checks at **2m** and **5m** indoors.

- [ ] Hotspot symmetrical  
- [ ] Corona smooth and even  
- [ ] Spill uniform on all sides  
- [ ] Tint consistent center → edge (within emitter norms)  
- [ ] Mode group behaves correctly (e.g., 1 → 10 → 35 → 100)

# **QC-3 — Electrical / Thermal**

## **Electrical**
- [ ] Driver solder joints inspected (no cold joints)  
- [ ] Lead wires have slack and are not pinched  
- [ ] Positive and negative springs aligned  
- [ ] Tail resistance low (no abnormal voltage drop under load)  
- [ ] All modes activate cleanly  
- [ ] No flicker under impact test (3 light taps on table edge)  
- [ ] Parasitic drain within expected spec  

## **Thermal**
- [ ] Driver secured with thermal adhesive if required  
- [ ] MCPCB mounted with thin, even thermal paste layer  
- [ ] Light warms evenly at 100% after 30s  
- [ ] No rapid spikes or visible output sag  
- [ ] Thermal regulation ramp is smooth, no oscillation

# **QC-4 — Aesthetic / Branding**

## **General**
- [ ] No grime, solder residue, or flux  
- [ ] Anodizing uniform with no bare aluminum unless intentional  
- [ ] No tool marks or clip scratches visible  
- [ ] Lens clean and haze-free  
- [ ] Tailcap edges clean, no burrs (S2/S21/S6 check)  

## **Branding**
- [ ] TFU label applied straight and centered  
- [ ] Serial format correct (e.g. TFU-E2-###)  
- [ ] Serial logged in build sheet  
- [ ] Included accessories match spec (O-ring, clip screw, etc.)  

## **Packaging**
- [ ] Insert card included  
- [ ] Desiccant pack included (if used)  
- [ ] Unit placed in protective sleeve  
- [ ] Pouch/box closes cleanly without stressing clip
