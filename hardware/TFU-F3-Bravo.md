# TFU-F3 “Bravo” – Directed Mule Flood Light

**Model:** TFU-F3B-001  
**Type:** High-CRI Directed Mule / Task Flood Light  
**Series:** F-Series (Field / Flood)  
**Host:** Convoy S16 — 21700 platform  
**Release:** Founder’s Edition – October 2025

## Overview
The **TFU-F3 Bravo** is the *definitive* TFU flood platform — a 21700-powered, quad-emitter directed mule built for wide-area illumination and perfect color accuracy.  
It runs a **2S2P Nichia 219B 4500 K array** driven by a **6 V 3 A buck regulator**, using the S16’s aluminum head cavity to naturally direct and blend the beam.  
This is not a lumen race — it’s controlled, high-CRI floodlighting optimized for realism, stability, and endurance.

## Character & Purpose
> “The F3 Bravo doesn’t chase throw — it *owns space.*”

The F3B is the founder’s high-CRI flood standard: a regulated, quad-emitter 6 V platform that turns every surface into a canvas of truth.  
Built for field operators, technicians, and makers who need long-form runtime and color accuracy without optical gimmicks.
