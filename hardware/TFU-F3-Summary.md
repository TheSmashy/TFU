The **TFU-F3** stands out as a robust and well-engineered mule-type light that surpasses typical offerings in the category.  
Unlike many small 18650-based mule lights built on the S2+ platformâ€”which often rely on washers or 3D-printed parts and lack true field readinessâ€”the F3 uses a solid **Convoy S16** host known for durability.

### Key Features of TFU-F3

- **Mechanical and Thermal Bonding:** The MCPCB is securely fastened to the host with dual screws and Loctite 242, ensuring exceptional mechanical integrity and a positive thermal pathâ€”critical improvements over typical builds that often use less secure interfaces.  
- **Power and Output:** Powered by a high-capacity **21700 P45B (4500 mAh)** cell, providing ample runtime and current delivery.  
- **Optics and Emitters:**  
  - *519A variant* â€” 4 Ã— Nichia 519A emitters driven by an 8 A buck driver, delivering bright, efficient output for tents or enclosed work areas.  
  - *219B variant* â€” 4 Ã— Nichia 219B emitters driven by a 5 A boost driver (3500 K / 4500 K CCT), tuned for warm flood beams and close-range accuracy.  
- **Versatility:** The 219B version excels in detailed up-close work, while the 519A version offers a stronger, more penetrating beam for area illumination.

### Summary

The **TFU-F3â€™s** design exemplifies TFUâ€™s commitment to field readinessâ€”superior mechanical and thermal construction paired with emitter and driver configurations optimized for real-world tasks.  
Itâ€™s a **professional-grade mule light** built to survive and perform where lesser hobby builds fall short.
