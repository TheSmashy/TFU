# TFU-F3 Mule Press

The TFU-F3 indeed stands out as a robust and well-engineered mule-type light that surpasses typical offerings in the category. Unlike many small 18650-based mule lights built on the S2+ platform—which often rely on washers or 3D-printed parts and lack true field readiness—the F3 uses a solid Convoy S16 host known for durability.[1]

### Key Features of TFU-F3

- **Mechanical and Thermal Bonding:** The MCPCB is securely screwed to the host with two screws using Loctite 242, ensuring exceptional mechanical integrity and a positive thermal path—critical improvements over typical builds that often involve less secure mounting or thermal interfaces.[1]
- **Power and Output:** It is powered by a high-capacity 21700 cell (P45B, 4500mAh) which provides ample runtime and current delivery.[1]
- **Optics and Emitters:** The light comes in two variants:
  - 4x Nichia 519A emitters driven by an 8A buck driver, delivering bright, efficient output suited for filling tents or small rooms.
  - 4x Nichia 219B emitters driven by a 5A boost driver at 3500K or 4500K CCT, optimized for warm flood beams and close-up inspections or administrative tasks.[1]
- **Versatility:** The 219B version particularly serves well for detailed up-close work while the 519A version offers a more powerful, longer-throw capable beam.[1]

### Summary

TFU-F3’s design reflects the brand’s commitment to field readiness, with superior mechanical and thermal construction paired with thoughtful emitter and driver choices tailored for practical use cases. This makes it an excellent choice for professionals needing a reliable, high-performance mule light that stands up to real-world conditions without compromise.[1]
