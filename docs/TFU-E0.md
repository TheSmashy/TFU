**TFU — Real Gear for Hard Use**  
**TFU-E0 — 14500 Instrument Light**

---

## Overview

The **TFU-E0** is a compact, regulated 14500 instrument light built for precision tasks and light EDC.

It is designed for clean beam fidelity, predictable output, and long-term reliability in a minimal platform.

_Primary mission:_ Deliver accurate, neutral light in a pocket-sized, thermally stable format.

## At a Glance

- **Host:** Convoy T5
- **Emitter:** Nichia 519A
- **CCT:** 5000K, High-CRI
- **Optic:** 30° bead TIR
- **Driver:** 1.5A regulated buck
- **Battery:** Vapcell F15 (included)
- **Mode Set:** **1% / 20% / 100%**

---

## Battery Notes

### Included Cell — Vapcell F15 (Recommended)

- Optimized for regulated 1.5A output
- Stable discharge curve
- Excellent balance of runtime and size
- Fully compatible with all E0 modes

### Alternate 14500 Cells

The E0 is designed around moderate, regulated output.  
High-discharge “hot rod” cells are unnecessary and provide no functional advantage in this platform.

Use quality 14500 cells only.  
Do not use alkaline AA or NiMH AA cells in this model.

---

## Output & Thermal Characteristics

The E0 prioritizes regulation and beam quality over peak lumen numbers.

### Mode Roles

- **1%** — Night-safe, close inspection, map reading
- **20%** — Bench work, diagnostics, general tasks
- **100%** — Full clarity for short-duration, high-detail tasks

At 1.5A, the E0 remains thermally controlled and efficient.  
Heat rise is moderate and appropriate for the host size.

If the light becomes uncomfortable to hold, power down and allow cooling.

## Estimated Runtime (Vapcell F15, 1.5A Buck)

| Mode | Output Level | Estimated Current Draw | Estimated Runtime* | Thermal Behavior |
|------|---------------|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 1%   | Low           | ~0.02–0.03A           | 40–60+ hours       | Cool, no rise    |
| 20%  | Task          | ~0.30A                | 4–5 hours          | Mild warmth      |
| 100% | Full Output   | 1.5A (regulated)      | ~50–65 minutes     | Warm, controlled |

\*Runtime estimates assume a healthy Vapcell F15 (~1500mAh) at room temperature.  
Actual runtime will vary based on cell age, ambient temperature, and airflow.

## Optical Profile

The 519A 5000K paired with a 30° bead optic delivers:

- Clean, neutral daylight tone
- Accurate color rendering
- Defined center with smooth spill
- No excessive hotspot intensity
- No harsh tint shift

This is an inspection beam — not a tactical beam.

## Using the TFU-E0

- **Half-press:** cycle modes  
- **Full click:** on/off  
- Mode order is fixed: 1% → 20% → 100%

The E0 is intentionally simple. No hidden strobes. No complex programming.

---

## Field Notes

- Compact enough for true pocket carry
- Ideal for tech kits, tool rolls, travel bags
- Balanced output for indoor and close-field work
- Minimal mass, maximum precision

The E0 is not the brightest TFU light.  
It is the most precise at its size.

---

## Care & Handling

- Install and remove the battery from the **tailcap end**
- Keep threads clean and lightly lubricated
- Do not over-tighten
- Store with the cell at partial charge for long-term storage
