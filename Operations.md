# TFU Operations Manual

Operational guidance for TFU field and EDC lights.  
For care, charging, and storage information, see [Care.md](Care.md).

## General Conduct
- **Do**: Treat your TFU light as you would any mission-critical tool.  
- **Don’t**: Assume indestructibility. Rugged ≠ immortal.  

---

## Environmental Ops
- **Do**: Run your light in rain, mud, or snow — all TFU lights are IPX8 sealed.  
- **Do**: For shore or littoral operations, secure in a seabag/drybag or double ziplock.  
- **Don’t**: Attempt long-duration dives. TFU builds are not dive torches.  

---

## Handling & Deployment
- **Do**: Expect SureFire-grade ruggedness — drops, knocks, and field carry are within spec.  
- **Do**: Use the clip or retention method as intended.  
- **Don’t**: Mount a TFU light to a weapon unless the model explicitly states “T-Series.”  
- **Use as an Impact Tool**: Only as a last resort. Your secondary or a good knife will always be a better option. TFU lights are designed to perform as illumination, not as weapons.

## Power Discipline
- **Do**: Use approved cells only (see [Charging.md](Charging.md)).  
- **Do**: Select the lowest output mode suitable for the task to extend runtime.  
- **Don’t**: Carry bare cells loose in kit. Always use protective cases.  

---

## Field Notes
- **Do**: Expect high head temperatures during sustained turbo. This is normal.  
- **Do**: Allow the light to cool before stowing in confined pouches or pockets.  
- **Don’t**: Modify drivers or MCPCBs unless you are fully prepared to void TFU’s field-grade warranty.

*TFU builds: Respectable on the surface. Hard underneath.*
