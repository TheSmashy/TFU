# TFU-F3 Mule

![TFU Logo](../TFU-LOGO.png)

The **TFU-F3** stands out as a robust and well-engineered mule-type light that surpasses typical offerings in the category.  
Unlike many small 18650-based mule lights built on the S2+ platformâ€”which often rely on washers or 3D-printed parts and lack true field readinessâ€”the F3 uses a solid **Convoy S16** host known for durability.

### Key Features of TFU-F3

- **Mechanical and Thermal Bonding:** The MCPCB is securely fastened to the host with dual screws and Loctite 242, ensuring exceptional mechanical integrity and a positive thermal pathâ€”critical improvements over typical builds that often use less secure interfaces.  
- **Power and Output:** Powered by a high-capacity **21700 P45B (4500 mAh)** cell, providing ample runtime and current delivery.  
- **Optics and Emitters:**  
  - *519A variant* â€” 4 Ã— Nichia 519A emitters driven by an 8 A buck driver 5000 K, delivering bright, efficient output for tents or enclosed work areas.  
  - *219B variant* â€” 4 Ã— Nichia 219B emitters driven by a 3 A boost driver 4500 K, tuned for warm flood beams and close-range accuracy.  
- **Versatility:** The 219B version excels in detailed up-close work, while the 519A version offers a stronger, more penetrating beam for area illumination.

### Emitter Configurations
| Variant | LED | Driver | CCT | Output Profile |
|----------|-----|---------|------|----------------|
| F3-A | Nichia 519A 5000 K | 6 V 8 A | Neutral-daylight | High-output mule |
| F3-B | Nichia 219B 4500 K | 6 V 3 A | Warm-neutral | High-CRI / endurance mule |

*Both configurations share the same host, pill, and thermal path. The 5000 K option aligns with TFUâ€™s new daylight baseline.*

### Summary

The **TFU-F3â€™s** design exemplifies TFUâ€™s commitment to field readinessâ€”superior mechanical and thermal construction paired with emitter and driver configurations optimized for real-world tasks.  
Itâ€™s a **professional-grade mule light** built to survive and perform where lesser hobby builds fall short.
