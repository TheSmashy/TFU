# Radical, Reckless Glock Theses

Because sometimes "the Pope" (Glock Inc., internet experts, range fudds) says things that aren’t the whole truth.  
Here are 20 hammer-blows of nuance, heresy, and actual mechanics.  

---

1. You *can* shoot lead out of a stock barrel, if you know what you’re doing.  
2. Moly-coating isn’t black magic, it’s physics.  
3. Ball-and-dummy drills expose flinch, not Glock trigger geometry.  
4. The “low-left” curse isn’t shooter error 100% of the time.  
5. Glock triggers don’t pull straight back — stop pretending they do.  
6. “Perfection” is a marketing slogan, not a mechanical state.  
7. Night sights don’t make you shoot better, they make you see better.  
8. A $30 trigger job is usually worth more than a $200 comp.  
9. Slide bite is a training scar, not a design flaw.  
10. Polymer flex is real, but it isn’t ruining your groups.  
11. Cleaning is more about **timing** than discipline — copper fouling in the bore can be your friend.  
12. .40 will fit in 9mm mags, and vice versa. (Don’t ask how I know, just trust the geometry.)  
13. A dry-fire pin and a Dremel are the best trigger job most people will ever need.  
14. The “match trigger” isn’t about being lighter — those ridges let you apply lateral pressure.  
15. Shoutout to the feds: thanks for teaching us to run triggers the “wrong” way to get them dead straight.  
16. Night sights aren’t really optional. If you can’t see, you can’t shoot.  
17. I swear to God, 9mm kills people. I have references.  
18. If a part comes in “tiers,” consider that you probably don’t need the part at all.  
19. Extended magazine and slide levers are the devil’s work — they solve problems you don’t have and create new ones.  
20. The more crap you bolt on, the more likely you are to forget how to just shoot the damn pistol.

## Conclusion

Shoot what works.  
Understand the mechanics.  
Ignore the Pope when he’s wrong.  

Hammer, not halo.
