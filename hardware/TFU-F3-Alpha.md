# TFU-F3 “Alpha” — Directed Mule Flood Light (519A / 5000 K)

**Model:** TFU-F3A  
**Series:** F-Series (Field / Flood)  
**Host:** Convoy S16 (21700 platform)  
**Type:** High-CRI Directed Mule / Field Work Light  
**Release:** Production Model — October 2025

## Overview

The **TFU-F3 Alpha** is the next-generation evolution of the original F3 platform:  
a 2S2P quad-emitter mule built around **Nichia 519A 5000 K (90 CRI)** and powered by a **6 V 5 A boost driver** for stable, efficient, real-world field use.

Replacing the earlier 6 V 8 A buck system, the Alpha’s upgraded boost regulator delivers a *sane*, optimized power curve:  
better efficiency, longer sustained output, and dramatically improved runtime without sacrificing the F3’s trademark wide, directed flood.

This is the **daylight-neutral** F3 — the clean white, high-CRI workhorse of the Field series.

## Performance Profile

- **Drive current:** 5 A regulated (boost architecture)  
- **Emitter configuration:** Quad 519A, 2S2P (~1.25 A per die equivalent)  
- **Output (est.):** 1 600–1 900 lm of crisp, high-CRI neutral white  
- **CRI:** ~90 (true daylight rendering)  
- **Runtime:** Strong sustained output with significantly improved longevity over the 8 A buck platform  
- **Thermal behavior:** Efficient conversion → slower heat saturation, reduced throttling  
- **Beam:** Wide-area mule flood with forward bias — clean, artifact-free  
- **Working range:** 0–20 m practical field illumination

## Character & Purpose

> **“Alpha is the field light you trust when you’re not chasing numbers — you’re doing work.”**

The TFU-F3 Alpha takes the lessons of the original F3 legacy platform and refines them into a balanced, daylight-neutral flood tool:

- Bright without being wasteful  
- Color-accurate without being warm  
- Efficient without sacrificing output  
- Mule-style situational awareness in any environment  

It is the **primary F3 production model** for technicians, inspectors, field operators, and anyone who needs a dependable work flood with real runtime.
