# TFU-E2 Urban   
## E-Series / Urban Environment Variant  

---

## Overview
The **TFU-E2 Urban** is the warm-tint, high-CRI, indoor-optimized branch of the E-Series.  
Designed specifically for interior movement, garage/utility work, close-range inspection, and general urban tasks.

It features:
- **519A 3500K R9080**  
- **15° bead TIR**  
- **5A buck driver (bypassed)**  
- **Tail spring bypass**  
- **No protective lens** (open-optic for maximum efficiency)  
- **Low-profile TFU tail clip**  

The result is a compact, field-ready, artifact-free flooder with razor-clean color rendering.

# 1. Hardware Architecture

### Host
- Convoy S2+ platform  
- Aluminum alloy body, Type III anodizing  
- **No front glass lens** — optic sits directly under the bezel for maximum output  
- **TFU Low-Profile Tail Clip** (black steel, minimal profile)  
- Serialized TFU marking (location varies by production batch)  
- Reverse-clicky tail switch  

### Physical Dimensions
- Length: ~118 mm  
- Tube diameter: 24 mm  
- Head diameter: 24 mm  
- Weight (no cell): ~70 g  
- Weight (with 30Q): ~116 g

# 2. Optical System

### Emitter
- **Nichia 519A 3500K R9080**  
- 90+ CRI with excellent R9  
- Comfortable warm neutral tint  
- Slightly rosy (negative Duv) → reduced glare on white walls  
- Superb indoor color accuracy  

### Optic
- **Convoy 15° Bead TIR**  
- Polycarbonate  
- No reflector, no OP texture — clean, controlled, artifact-free flood  
- Designed for indoor clarity and wide peripheral vision  

### Beam Characteristics
- Very smooth wide flood with a tight usable core  
- No rings, petals, or donut holes  
- Excellent for:
  - Garages, basements, hallways  
  - Utility/mechanical work  
  - Close-range inspection  
  - Urban navigation at night

# 3. Electrical System

### Driver
- **5A Buck Driver — Bypassed**  
  - Bypass reduces resistance and improves efficiency  
  - More stable high-mode output  
  - Cleaner regulation across voltage curve  
  - No PWM on any mode  

### Mode Group
- **1 → 10 → 35 → 100** (Group 10)  
- Tail-clicky optimized cycling
- Memory off - activates on 1% every time

### Current Draw (approx.)
- 1%: ~15–20 mA  
- 10%: ~150–200 mA  
- 35%: ~700–900 mA  
- 100%: 4.8–5.0 A  

### Switch + Tail Assembly
- Mechanical reverse-clicky  
- Brass retaining ring  
- **Tail spring bypassed** (22 AWG)  
  - Lower resistance  
  - Improved turbo output  
  - Faster voltage recovery after mode changes

# 4. Thermal Behavior

### MCPCB
- DTP copper  
- MX-4 thermal interface (TFU spec: thin, even spread)  

### Thermal Notes
- Smooth thermal rise due to wide beam  
- No aggressive thermal oscillation  
- Better indoor thermal behavior compared to throw-centric optics  

### Recommended Sustained Modes
- Indoors: 10–35%  
- Outdoors: 35–100% with airflow

# 5. Power System

### Supported Cells
- 18650 (flat-top or button-top)  
- Protected cells work but are not preferred  

### Recommended
- **Samsung 30Q** (best overall performance)  
- **Molicel M35A** (cooler runtime curve)  

### Practical Runtime
- 1%: multi-day indoor utility and low signature navigation  
- 10%: reading, panel work, navigation  
- 35%: universal indoor task mode  
- 100%: bursts or outdoor movement

# 6. QC Standards (Urban Variant)

### Optical QC
- Beamshot checks at 2 m and 5 m  
- Zero ring artifacts  
- Uniform tint from center to edge  
- Optic seated flush under bezel  

### Mechanical QC
- **Tailcap symmetry check**  
- **Low-profile clip alignment**  
- No wobble, no rattle  
- Switch travel must be centered and clean  

### Electrical QC
- Mode group confirmed  
- Impact-test flicker check (3 taps)  
- Current reading spot-check at tail

# 7. Role & Design Rationale

### Primary Use Cases
- Urban navigation  
- Indoor mechanical/repair tasks  
- Comms/nav kit illumination  
- Shop/garage/workbench duty  
- Low-glare night movement  

### Why This Build Works
- **3500K 519A** reduces glare and eye fatigue indoors  
- **15° bead TIR** gives a perfect “work light” flood  
- **No front glass** increases efficiency + reduces reflections  
- **Bypassed driver & tail spring** guarantee stable high output  
- **Low-profile tail clip** keeps snagging to an absolute minimum  

The Urban is **the** E-Series model built for interior environments, where clarity and comfort beat raw lumen numbers.
