# Care & Maintenance

Your TFU light is built to last. With a little care, it will serve you for decades.

## Cleaning
- **Exterior:** Wipe with a microfiber cloth to remove dust, sweat, or fingerprints.  
- **Lens/Optic:** Use a microfiber cloth or a lens wipe with a little isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Avoid paper towels or abrasive cloths that can scratch.  
- **Threads & O-rings:** A light wipe-down with a cloth is usually enough. If dirty, use a dry toothbrush or cotton swab.

## Lubrication
- Apply a **thin film of silicone grease** to O-rings when they appear dry or after cleaning.  
- Do not use petroleum-based lubricants — they can degrade rubber.

## Batteries
- Use only **high-quality cells** from reputable sources.  
- Store spares at ~3.7–3.8V in a cool, dry place.  
- Inspect cells regularly for dents, tears, or swelling. Retire damaged cells immediately.  
- When not in use for long periods, remove the battery from the light.

## General Tips
- Avoid submerging unless the light is specifically rated for diving.  
- Don’t overtighten the tailcap or bezel. Snug is enough.  
- Treat the light like a precision tool — it’ll return the favor with reliability.
