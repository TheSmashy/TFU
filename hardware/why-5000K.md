# Why 5000 K?

When TFU began, 4500 K was the sweet spot—warm enough for comfort, neutral enough for true color rendering.  
As emitter availability changed, the 519A 4500 K was discontinued, and the 5000 K bin proved the closest match in behavior and spectral balance.

### The Decision
- **Color Consistency:** 5000 K aligns with daylight-neutral white used in most field work and inspection environments.  
- **Emitter Availability:** Nichia’s current production favors 5000 K bins with stable output and high CRI.  
- **Legacy Continuity:** Early TFU E1 models already used 5000 K options, making this transition consistent with existing designs.  
- **Operational Clarity:** In real-world use, the difference between 4500 K and 5000 K is negligible compared to driver behavior and optic choice.

### The Legacy 4500 K
A handful of lights—such as the **TFU-F1 Founder’s Edition**—retain 4500 K emitters as historical builds. They mark the start of the TFU brand’s engineering philosophy: build for function, preserve lineage.
