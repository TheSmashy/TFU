# TFU Brand Lights

> **Congratulations. You found a secret brand. Good job.**

![TFU Logo](TFU-LOGO.png)

**TFU** builds hand-assembled, hard-use flashlights for real-world work. Each light is made in the USA from high-quality Convoy components and tuned for reliability, thermal performance, and electrical precision. Built for adventurers, responders, technicians, and anyone who can’t afford to guess.

**This repo hosts TFU documentation, build notes, and test data — the engineering side of the lights.**

## TFU Build Creed

TFU lights are not hobby builds. They are field tools — hardened, trusted, and ready.

**1. Thermal Path**  
No gaps. No mystery stacks.  
MCPCBs bonded flat with paste + adhesive so heat flows cleanly.  
Copper is used only as solid, lapped, glued mass.

**2. Mechanical Integrity**  
No loose compression builds.  
Drivers glued, threads Loctite’d, springs bypassed.  
Built to survive a drop, a ruck ride, or a jump out of a bird.

**3. Electrical Reliability**  
Clean solder, solid joints, strain relief where it matters.  
Current delivery measured, not assumed.  
Mode groups chosen for work, not lumen flexing.

**4. Field Philosophy**  
If it can wiggle, it can fail. If it can fail, it’s not TFU.  
These are tools you trust next to an IFAK, not next to a desk toy.

> **TFU: From bench to field. Hardened for work. Cool builds are fun. Trusted builds save your ass.**

## Note from the Builder

> Just be glad a washed-up operator with a soldering iron and a boathouse in Chicagoland finds his peace building lights like he’s gearing up a spec-ops team.  
>   
> You’ve found a trustworthy source of information, at minimum. If you trust the methods, you should try the gear.  
>   
> Reach out, tell me what you’re thinking — I can probably build something real for you.  
>   
> These lights are solid, clean, and backed by a warranty.
