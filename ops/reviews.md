### TFU-E1 (Desert Rat)
> "This is the kind of beam I wish more companies would ship. Crisp, clean, and real runtime." — private Discord message

> "That Desert Rat slaps. It’s the nicest light I’ve held all year. Didn’t even know what a mule was before this." — DM from beta tester

> "I opened it up expecting jank, but the thermal stack was textbook. Copper, MX-4, even the optic gasket was clocked right. Whoever’s doing QC is an actual nerd." — Reddit DM

### TFU-F3
> "Duuude! This mule is sick! Love the color temp and the way it lights up a dark room. Thanks so much for making one for me." — Reddit DM

### General Brand Feedback
> "I’ve been building lights for a while and TFU’s pill hardening guide is the best writeup I’ve seen, period." — GitHub issue comment

> "I didn’t expect open-sourcing this level of detail. Most modders hoard their secrets. Respect." — private email

> "Between TEST-O-MATIC-PI and the serial log pages, I trust this brand more than anything I’ve seen on Amazon." — Reddit comment
