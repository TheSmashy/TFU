## Concept

The **TFU-PE series** represents the highest expression of the Everyday Carry platform.

Where E-series lights are practical field tools, **PE lights are refined instruments** — built with premium emitters, premium materials, optimized beam shaping, and meticulously executed mechanical details.

Every PE build is designed to feel deliberate in the hand and disciplined in output.

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Premium Emitters

- **Nichia 519A (R9080)** as standard  
- Tint-balanced, high-CRI output  
- Consistent bin selection  
- Beam integrity prioritized over raw lumen chasing  

Color accuracy and beam quality come first.

---

### 2. Premium Materials

PE builds may include:

- **Titanium tubes (18350 / 18650)**  
- **Copper thermal components or spacers**  
- Precision-machined aluminum hosts  
- AR-coated glass  
- Bespoke gasket selections  
- Carefully matched O-ring colors  

Materials are selected for:

- Thermal efficiency  
- Mechanical durability  
- Visual coherence  
- Long-term stability  

No novelty finishes. No gimmicks.

---

### 3. Optimized Beam Architecture

Each PE light is built around a deliberate beam profile:

- Selected **Carclo or Kai TIR optics**
- Carefully matched reflectors (when used)
- Custom gasket height choices
- Diffusion applied only when it improves real-world usability

The goal:

- Clean hotspot  
- Even spill  
- No tint shift artifacts  
- No distracting edges  

Beam tuning is intentional — not accidental.

---

### 4. Premium Interface & Hardware

PE builds typically include:

- **Metal switch buttons** (no lighted switches unless purpose-built)
- Titanium deep-carry clips (often DLC-coated)
- Polished or treated threads
- Clean lens stacks with proper compression

Carry geometry is evaluated, not assumed.

If the clip isn’t correct, it’s replaced.

---

### 5. Electrical Discipline

PE builds prioritize both performance *and* reliability.

Depending on configuration:

- Regulated **buck or boost drivers**
- Springs bypassed when it improves efficiency and regulation stability
- LVP configured appropriately
- Driver rings secured with thread locker when optimal
- Clean solder work, minimal resistance paths

But:

- No unsafe current levels
- No uncontrolled heat profiles
- No “spec sheet hero numbers”

Reliability > ego output.

---

## Operating Profile (Typical)

While configuration varies by build, most PE lights follow a disciplined mode structure:

**1 % / 10 % / 35 % / 100 %**  
Memory: Off  

- 1 % — night vision safe  
- 10–35 % — sustained work  
- 100 % — controlled burst  

Output is usable, not theatrical.

---

## Field Identity

A PE light should:

- Feel solid but not excessive  
- Run clean and regulated  
- Deliver high-CRI light without tint drama  
- Carry deep and disappear in pocket  
- Age gracefully  

It is a light for:

- Inspection  
- Mechanical work  
- Quiet night tasks  
- Field carry with refinement  

---

## What Makes It “Premium”

Premium in TFU terms means:

- Better emitters  
- Better materials  
- Better beam control  
- Better carry hardware  
- Better electrical tuning  
- Better execution  

Not just more expensive parts — but more intentional choices.
