# Lifetime Warranty – Workmanship & Materials

Your TFU light is covered for life (original owner) against defects in **workmanship** and **materials**.

## Not Covered
- Normal wear and tear
- Cosmetic blemishes
- Damage from gross abuse or unauthorized mods

## If Something Goes Wrong
Contact me with your serial/model number and a brief description — I’ll make it right with **repair**, **replacement**, or **fair-cost service**. Most repairs handled within 14 days after receipt.

## If You Did Something Wild
Fell out of a helicopter? Run over by a truck? Still reach out — I’m happy to work with you. At minimum, you’ll get a **discounted repair** or a **break on a new light** (especially if the story’s good).
