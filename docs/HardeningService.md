# TFU Hardening Service

## Tier One – Hardening ($10 + $5 return shipping - CONUS)
- Reseat MCPCB with MX-4 or equivalent  
- Secure driver & thermal path (pot/adhesive as needed)  
- Copper wrap for snug fit & heat transfer  
- Clean & tighten contacts (driver ring, switch, springs)  
- Spring tune/bypass  
- Loctite retaining rings  
- Full runtime/thermal test at 100% load  

**Result:** Proven, hardened tool. May have scuffs from testing — no shelf queens leave my bench.

## Tier Two – Upgrades (ask for quote)
- Emitter swaps (to spec or I choose based on use case — *wise to go with option B*)  
- Driver swaps (single-mode, buck/boost, whatever fits your mission)  
- TIR optic installs / beam tuning  
- Other mods discussed case-by-case

## Disclaimer
I don’t warranty your cells, switches, or ancient hosts.  
What I do guarantee: the work I perform is tested and proven before it leaves my bench.
