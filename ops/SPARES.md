# TFU Spare Parts Policy  
**Path:** `ops/SPARES.md`  
**Purpose:** Defines TFU’s spare part and inclusion policy.  
Yes, we include goodies. Yes, sometimes it’s just an O-ring.

---

## Baseline Spares

Every TFU light includes:
- (1) **Body-sized O-ring** (matched to host diameter)  
- (1) **TFU QR card** (serial + docs link)  
- (1) **TFU sticker** (for morale and identification)

## O-Ring Sizing Reference

Different TFU series use different host diameters. O-rings are matched accordingly.

| Size Category | Used On | Nominal Outer Diameter | Notes |
|:---------------|:--------|:------------------------|:------|
| **S2+ size** | E-series (E0–E3), some early prototypes | 24 mm | Standard Convoy S2+/S2 body seals. |
| **S21G / S26 size** | F-series (F1–F3) | 27 mm | Slightly thicker; provides better compression on larger 21700 hosts. |
| **T-series size** | T1–T2 tactical lights | 22 mm | Compact seal optimized for tail actuation and frequent disassembly. |

> **Note:** O-rings are greased prior to shipment. Replace with the same class as host diameter; incorrect sizing can cause thread binding or leaks.

## Model-Specific Spares

| Model | Included Spares | Notes |
|:------|:----------------|:------|
| **TFU-E0** | None | Integrated USB-C charging cell — fully turnkey. |
| **TFU-E1** | (1) S2+-size body O-ring | Boost driver, sealed head — no user-serviceable parts required. |
| **TFU-E2** | (1) S2+-size body O-ring<br>(1) Kai reverse clicky w/ bypass<br>(1) Kai 3-in-1 TIR (flat optic) | Switch and optic variability justify full spare set. |
| **TFU-E3** | (2) T-series O-rings (body + tail) | Compact 14500 build — includes additional seal. |
| **TFU-F1** | (1) S21G-size body O-ring<br>(1) Stock OP reflector<br>(1) Optional 30° matte TIR optic | Enables swap between 15° bead (standard), 30° matte (wide), or reflector configuration for beam preference. |
| **TFU-F2** | (1) S21G-size body O-ring | Standard field build — minimal service parts. |
| **TFU-F3** | (1) S21G-size body O-ring | Field mule — no optic swap, all function. |
| **TFU-T1** | (1) T-series O-ring<br>(1) Shaved boot (forward clicky) | Maintains switch performance under hard use. |
| **TFU-Custom / Proto** | As built | Refer to serialized documentation. |

## Optional / Situational Spares

| Spare | When Included | Rationale |
|:------|:---------------|:-----------|
| **Custom clip bolt** | When non-standard TFU hardware used | Avoids downtime if user loses hardware. |
| **Shaved boot** | Forward-clicky builds | Keeps action smooth after extended use. |
| **Switch assembly** | Known host stress points (Kai, etc.) | Enables quick repair without full teardown. |

---

## Notes  

- O-rings are **consumables** — TFU ships greased; maintain with Super Lube or equivalent.  
- Extras are **intentional.** If it’s in the box, it’s there for a reason.  
- F3 users: no condom included. You’re already the flex.
