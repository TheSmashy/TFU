### TFU-F3 Hardening Checklist â€“ S16 Mule Build

**Thermal & Mechanical Interface**  
- [x] Apply **CS109** thermal adhesive to driver perimeter to secure and improve heat transfer to pill shelf  
- [x] Spread **MX-4** thermal paste evenly under MCPCB for full contact with shelf  
- [x] Apply **Loctite 242** to retaining rings (driver & tail) for vibration resistance  
- [x] Apply **Loctite 242** to MCPCB screws for additional mechanical security

**Thread & Seal Preparation**  
- [x] Apply light coat of **thermal paste + Super Lube** mix to battery tube (barrel) threads for smooth assembly and improved thermal path  
- [x] Lubricate bezel threads with **Super Lube** for corrosion protection and smoother removal/installation  
- [x] Inspect and lubricate bezel o-ring with Super Lube to ensure IPX8 seal

**Final Assembly QC**  
- [x] Verify factory glass lens is seated clean and free of debris  
- [x] Confirm o-ring placement and compression at bezel  
- [x] Torque bezel to snug fit without over-tightening  
- [x] Test switch action and mode changes post-assembly  
- [x] Conduct initial waterproof dunk test (every light gets a dunk, just not for 15 minutes)
