## Thermal & Output Warnings

The T2 is a compact light — physics applies.

### Using Group 8 (F12 recommended)
1% / 10% / 50%  
- Excellent for field use  
- Stable thermals  
- No strict time limits

### Using Group 5 (H10 only)
1% / 20% / 100%  
- **100% is extremely high output for a T2-class host**  
- Expect rapid heat rise  
- Output will drop quickly as the driver protects the light

**TFU recommendation:**  
- Treat **100%** as a *burst mode*  
- **Maximum recommended ON time: ~45 seconds**

If it feels too hot to hold, stop.
