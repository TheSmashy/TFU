# TFU-E0 Pocket Series (Concept Hardware Sheet)

## Overview
The **TFU-E0** is the smallest entry in the TFU Everyday Carry (E-series) lineup. Built on the Convoy T5 host, it is designed as a compact, reliable, and gift-ready EDC light that balances everyday practicality with TFU’s hardened ethos. 

A “gateway” light into the TFU brand: small enough to pocket, simple enough for anyone to use, and tough enough to carry TFU’s seal of reliability.
