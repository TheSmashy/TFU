# TFU HEAVY INDUSTRIES  
## P-21 — Packaging & Serialization Protocol  
**Revision 1.0 — December 2025**  
**Author: WM**

---

## 1. Purpose
This document defines the standard procedure for preparing, labeling, serializing, and packaging TFU flashlights for shipment.  
Consistency builds trust. Repetition builds reliability.

This protocol ensures every TFU unit leaves the boathouse with the same professional, rugged workflow.

---

## 2. Required Materials

### Stickers
- **Model Label**  
  (e.g., *TFU-E2 — 219BT 4500K — 3V 5A Buck — SN-###*)
- **Scan for Docs** (TFU logo + QR to GitHub model page)
- **TFU QC PASS — BUILT IN THE USA**

### Insert Materials
- TFU card (front: philosophy & usage; back: QR + handwritten notes)
- Paperclip (for card + sticker bundling)
- Part kit (O-rings, spacers, lanyard, etc.)

### Shipping Materials
- White flashlight box  
- Bubble sleeve **or** kraft paper wrap  
- Outer mailer box  
  - **7×5×2** for E-series, T2-scale  
  - **8×5×3** for F3/T1-scale units
- Kraft packing paper (void fill)
- Shipping tape  
- Shipping label

---

## 3. Serialization Standard

All TFU lights follow one rigid serial architecture:  
```
TFU-<MODEL>-<SERIAL>

Example:
TFU-E1-001
```

### Rules
- No spaces  
- No nonstandard abbreviations  
- Serial increments by **build**, not sale  
- Duplicates are unacceptable  
- A printed serial label is placed **inside the barrel** as the permanent provenance tag  

---

## 4. Label Placement

### 4.1 Model Label (Specs + Serial)
**Placement:** Top-right of the TFU card  
**Purpose:** Quick spec/variant identification during QC.

### 4.2 “Scan for Docs” Label
**Placement:** Centered on the top lid of the white flashlight box  
**Purpose:** Directs buyer to GitHub documentation.

### 4.3 “TFU QC PASS”
**Primary:** On the outer mailer box flap  
**Alternate:** As a seal around bubble wrap inside the mailer  
**Purpose:** Final inspection mark.

---

## 5. Card Writing Standards

The back of every TFU card MUST include:

- **Serial number**  
- **Build notes** (Cu spacer, bypass, revised optics, etc.)  
- **BH Appr.** (boathouse approval)  
- **Initials** of builder (WM)

### Example
```
SN #001
Cu Spacer
BH Appr.
WM
```

**Ink:** Ultra-fine black Sharpie  
**Handwriting:** Small, clean, intentional  
No cursive. No flourish. Field-tool aesthetic only.

## 6. Packaging Workflow

### Step 1 — Final Light Inspection
- Emitter alignment  
- Optic seating  
- Switch feel  
- Mode spacing  
- 10–15 second thermal bump check  
- Tailcap torque & O-ring seating  

### Step 2 — Insert Serial Tag
Place printed serial label **inside the barrel**, adhesive against tube wall.  
This is the permanent provenance tag.

### Step 3 — Prepare the TFU Card
- Apply Model Label  
- Paperclip TFU sticker + card  
- Add handwritten notes on the back  

### Step 4 — Load the White Flashlight Box
- Wrap light in bubble sleeve **or** kraft wrap  
- Insert part kit  
- Close box  
- Apply “Scan for Docs” label  

### Step 5 — Load Outer Mailer
- Card bundle goes in first  
- White box on top  
- Add kraft paper to prevent shifting  
- Seal with tape  
- Apply **TFU QC PASS**  
- Apply shipping label  

### Step 6 — Final Check
Confirm before sealing:
- Correct model  
- Correct serial  
- Sticker alignment straight  
- QR functional  
- Light passes last click test  

Once sealed, the mailer is **live**. Do not reopen unless compromised.

## 7. Brand Aesthetic Rules

- No flags or “tactical cosplay” elements  
- Black-on-white only  
- Minimalist field-tool aesthetic  
- Zero decoration, zero cuteness  
- Stickers must never resemble AliExpress-style branding  
- Packaging should feel like small-run professional equipment  
  — not boutique, not mall-ninja, not Instagram EDC gear  

TFU is **field hardware**.
