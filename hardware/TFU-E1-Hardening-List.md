### TFU-E1 Hardening Checklist â€“ S2+ EDC Build

**Thermal & Mechanical Interface**  
- [x] Sand **driver perimeter** for precise, secure fit in the driver cavity  
- [x] Apply **Loctite 242** to driver retaining ring for vibration resistance  
- [x] Apply **CS109** thermal adhesive to driver perimeter to secure and improve heat transfer to pill shelf  
- [x] Apply **CS109** thermal adhesive to large driver components for additional heat sinking and stability  
- [x] Spread **MX-4** thermal paste evenly under MCPCB for full contact with shelf  
- [x] Apply small dab of **CS109** in center of MCPCB shelf for hardened thermal path  
- [x] Apply **Loctite 242** to tail retaining ring for vibration resistance  
- [x] Install **tail spring bypass** with 22 AWG wire for improved current delivery and switch feel

**Thread & Seal Preparation**  
- [x] Apply light coat of **Super Lube** to battery tube threads for smooth assembly  
- [x] Lubricate tailcap o-ring with Super Lube to maintain IPX8 seal

**Final Assembly QC**  
- [x] Verify lens and optic are seated clean and free of debris  
- [x] Confirm o-ring placement and compression at head  
- [x] Torque retaining rings to snug fit without over-tightening  
- [x] Test switch action and mode changes post-assembly  
- [x] Conduct initial waterproof dunk test (every light gets a dunk, just not 15 minutes)
