# TFU-E0 Instrument Series (Hardware Specification)

## Overview

The **TFU-E0** is a 14500-format instrument light built for precision tasks and light EDC.

Compact, regulated, and intentionally simple, the E0 delivers high-fidelity neutral light in a minimal form factor. It is not a novelty piece and not a tactical light — it is a calibrated pocket instrument.

Small enough to disappear. Serious enough to trust.

## Host & Form Factor

- **Base:** Convoy T5 host  
- **Material:** Anodized aluminum  
- **Cell:** 14500 (included)  
- **Switch:** Tail clicky, mechanical  
- **Carry Profile:** Slim, low-mass pocket instrument  

The T5 platform keeps geometry tight and neutral. No aggressive styling. No ornamentation. Just controlled proportions.

## Optical System

- **Emitter:** Nichia 519A 5000K (CRI90+)  
- **Optic:** 30° bead TIR  
- **Beam Character:** Neutral, defined center with smooth spill  
- **Color Tone:** Industrial daylight (5000K)  

The 519A at 5000K reinforces the E0’s instrument role — accurate rendering, no tint drama, no warmth bias. The 30° bead optic produces a clean inspection beam suitable for technical work, reading, diagnostics, and close-field navigation.

This is beam fidelity over theatrics.

## Driver & Regulation

- **Driver:** 1.5A regulated buck  
- **Mode Spacing:** 1% – 20% – 100%  
- **Output Profile:** Stable, predictable, thermally sane  

The 1.5A buck driver prioritizes efficiency, thermal stability, and long-term reliability. Output is intentionally restrained to preserve regulation and maintain safe sustained operation.

### Mode Roles

- **1%** – Night-safe, close inspection, map reading  
- **20%** – General task / bench / panel work  
- **100%** – Full output for short, high-clarity tasks  

No hidden strobes. No gimmicks. No overdriven turbo.

## Power System

- **Included Cell:** Vapcell F15 14500  
- **Discharge Capability:** Fully compatible with 1.5A regulation  
- **Runtime:** Optimized for multi-hour practical use  

The Vapcell F15 provides a stable voltage curve appropriate for regulated output in a compact form factor. Cell inclusion ensures consistency and predictable performance.

## Thermal & Assembly Standards

- MX-4 thermal interface compound  
- Proper emitter seating and alignment  
- Tail spring bypass as required for electrical efficiency  
- Switch seating verified for tactile consistency  
- Full beam and runtime QC before shipment  

Each E0 is built as a long-term tool, not a novelty object.

## Mission Profile

- Technical inspection  
- Bench diagnostics  
- Field-adjacent EDC  
- Travel-friendly precision light  
- Minimalist daily carry  

The E0 exists for users who want accurate light in the smallest TFU footprint.

It is not the brightest in the lineup.  
It is not the most aggressive.  
It is the most precise.
