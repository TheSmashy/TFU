## Mission & Philosophy of Use
The TFU-PE1 began as a **pure mule** focused on maximum CRI and tint fidelity.  
R2 evolves the concept into a **sealed, field-capable EDC** by introducing a shorter copper spacer and precision optic — keeping the soul of the mule while adding durability, water resistance, and practical beam control.

- **Role:** close- to mid-range inspection, work, or field light  
- **Beam:** balanced spot + spill, slightly warm-shifted through optic  
- **Operator focus:** reliability, sealed construction, predictable output curve

## Mode Group (recommended)
**1 % / 10 % / 35 % / 100 %**, memory **off**  
- 1 % = night / reading  
- 10 – 35 % = work / inspection  
- 100 % = burst / field task

## Assembly Notes
1. Seat **7 mm copper spacer** with a thin, even layer of MX-4.  
2. Solder and center **519A MCPCB**, ensure flat contact.  
3. Dry-fit **optic + AR lens** to verify focus and O-ring compression.  
4. Apply **Loctite 242** to driver and tail rings.  
5. Finalize stack: spacer → MCPCB → optic → O-ring → glass → bezel.  
6. Optional: light DC-Fix disc inside glass for extra flood diffusion.

## Field Performance
- **CCT:** ≈ 4400 K perceived  
- **CRI:** ≥ 90  
- **Beam:** Defined hotspot w/ wide spill; no green edge  
- **Thermals:** Stable regulation via buck driver + short spacer mass  
- **Runtime:** 30–40 min on turbo; multi-hour on mids  

---

## Care & Use
- Clean lens and O-rings with isopropyl only.  
- Avoid long 100 % runs in stagnant air — drop to 35 % for sustained work.  
- Re-lube threads and replace O-rings annually if opened frequently.  

> **PE1 R2** keeps the aesthetic and soul of the original mule but adds structure, seal, and discipline — ready for the field without losing its shine.
