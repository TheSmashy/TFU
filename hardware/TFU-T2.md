## TFU Assembly Notes

- MCPCB seated with thin MX-4 layer; leads tinned and centered.  
- Driver installed with four CS109 anchor points, Loctite 242 on retainer.  
- Spring bypass soldered clean, 22 AWG silicone, no flux residue.  
- Kapton applied to lead crossovers and driver edge.  
- Lens and bezel threads lubed with Super Lube.  
- 24 h cure minimum before final runtime test.  
- Passed 1 m drop and rain spray tests without failure.

### Tactical Mode Rationale  

The TFU-T2 is configured for deliberate control in high-stress or low-light environments. **Group 10 (20 % / 100 %) with memory ON** balances runtime discipline and immediate power:  

- **20 % mode** provides stable, thermally safe output for navigation, map reading, and general work.  
- **100 % mode** delivers full 5 A drive for short-burst use — blinding output on demand, without mode cycling.  
- **Memory ON** allows the light to be pre-staged in either mode, ensuring predictable activation when seconds matter.  

At full 5 A drive the T2 body will reach **uncomfortable surface temperatures within 60–90 seconds.**  
For operator safety and emitter longevity, TFU recommends limiting continuous operation at 100 % to **45 seconds max**, followed by at least **90 seconds of cooldown.**  

This configuration supports both **low-visibility discipline** and **rapid escalation**, matching TFU’s field-ready design ethos: *no wasted clicks, no confusion, just light when you need it.*
