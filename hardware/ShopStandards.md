# TFU Shop Standards (v0.1)

*Baseline practices and materials applied across all TFU builds. Unless otherwise noted, these standards are assumed.*

---

## Core Practices

### Cleaning & Prep
- Degrease brass rings, threads, and contact points with **IPA 99%**.  
- Dry thoroughly before reassembly.  
- Remove old thermal paste before reseating MCPCBs or drivers.  

### Thread Treatment
- Apply a *small drop* of **Loctite 242 (Blue)**.  
- Seat part, back out to align, then snug down.  
- Target = **serviceable but secure**.  

### Spring Bypasses
- Use short, neat silicone wire (22–24 AWG typical).  
- Cut wire to length (≈10-15 mm).  
- Ensure no excess length presses into switch or driver cavity.  
- Verify bypass clears retaining rings.  

### Thermal Interface
- Use **MX-4 thermal paste** or equivalent, non-conductive.  
- Apply thin, even layer — avoid excess.  
- Confirm full surface contact before tightening.  

### QC Pass
- **Beam Test:** white wall at 2 m.  
- **Lux Check:** phone app baseline acceptable.  
- **Thermal Check:** 60 s runtime at max mode.  
- **Visual Inspection:** no beam artifacts, wires tucked, threads clean.

## Stock Chemicals
- **IPA 99%** – Cleaning, degreasing, prep.  
- **Loctite 242 (Blue)** – Removable thread locker.  
- **CS109 Thermal Adhesive** – Permanent/semi-permanent driver/component securing.  
- **MX-4 Thermal Paste** – Non-conductive thermal interface.  
- **Rosin Flux Pen** – Clean solder flow for bypasses and driver work.  
- **Isopropyl wipes / Kimwipes** – Cleaning and inspection.  

**Optional / Nice-to-have:**  
- **Kapton tape** – Insulation, emitter dome protection.  
- **Contact cleaner spray** – Switch and thread refresh.

## Reference
- These standards apply across **all TFU builds** unless explicitly noted.  
- Deviations or exceptions are documented in individual build logs.
