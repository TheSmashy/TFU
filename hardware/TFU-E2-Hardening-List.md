## üî© Steps

### 1. Extract and Inspect Pill
- Remove pill from host
- Inspect shelf for flatness and any existing lead hole
- Clean surface of machining oils or debris

### 2. Center and Drill Wire Hole
- Mark center with a **center punch**
- Drill **3/16" (4.75‚ÄØmm)** through the shelf for lead pass-through
- Work slowly, use oil, and clear chips frequently

### 3. Deburr and Bevel
- Deburr **both sides** of the drilled hole
- Optionally **bevel** the edges slightly (15‚Äì30¬∞ chamfer)
  - Prevents lead damage
  - Aids in thermal mating and wire routing

### 4. Dry Fit Spacer
- Place MTN spacer over hole
- Confirm flush contact with the pill
- Ensure no wobble or rocking
- Verify lead holes align with pill hole for clean routing

### 5. Apply Thermal Materials
- Apply a **thin layer of MX-4** to the pill shelf
- Add **small dabs or a perimeter ring of CS109** thermal adhesive between pill and spacer
  - Avoid getting adhesive in the wire hole or on the spacer top surface

### 6. Seat Spacer
- Press spacer firmly onto pill shelf
- Ensure wire holes are still aligned
- Optionally thread pill into host or clamp lightly to cure

### 7. Cure and Clean
- Allow CS109 to cure per manufacturer instructions (usually ~1 hour to handle, 24h full set)
- Remove any excess adhesive with alcohol

### 8. Proceed with Build
- Thread leads through
- Solder MCPCB
- Final assembly: optic, o-ring, bezel
