## Design Philosophy

- **Legacy Friendly** – Fits most SureFire and Solarforce P60 hosts.  
- **Predictable Output** – Regulated current, no step-downs or surprises.  
- **Serviceable** – Components are standard-size and easily replaced.  
- **Operator Simplicity** – One click = light. That’s it.

## Builder Notes

- Tested with P45B and M35A — thermally stable and excellent runtime.  
- Tint on 219C 4000 K is neutral-warm with good color separation and zero green.  
- Drop-in shell is the cost driver; light-engine components remain low-cost and high-reliability.  
- Apply thermal paste between pill and reflector base for optimal dissipation.

## Status

**Development Stage:** Prototype validation underway  
**Next Step:** Thermal regulation testing in SureFire 6P and Solarforce L2 hosts
