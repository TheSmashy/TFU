# TFU-T1 (In Development)

## Series: Tactical (T Series)

Mission‑focused lights designed for controlled output, momentary activation, and high candela throw.

---

## Prototype Configuration

- **Host:** Convoy M2
- **Emitter:** Luminus SFT40, 6500K
- **Driver:** 8A Buck Driver
- **Optics:** Smooth Reflector (stock M2)
- **Switch:** Forward Clicky (momentary capable)
- **Mode Group:** 5 (1% – 20% – 100%)
- **Cell:** Samsung 25R (high‑drain) or Samsung 30Q (extended runtime)

---

## Tactical Identity

- **High Candela Throw:** SFT40 produces a tight beam ideal for distance ID and signaling.
- **Simple, Direct UI:** Limited modes, no strobe/disco functions. Easy muscle memory.
- **Momentary Activation:** Forward clicky enables light discipline and tactical use cases.
- **Durability:** M2 host with crenulated bezel and robust construction.

## Test & Evaluation Notes

- **Runtime/Regulation:** Log thermal and output curve at 8A with Pi sensor rig.
- **Beam Profile:** Compare throw vs. flood against TFU-F2 (M1/B35AM) for role distinction.
- **Usability Drills:** One‑hand activation, momentary control, confirm no accidental mode cycling.
- **Cells:** 25R for high-drain reliability; 30Q as viable option for longer missions.

## Status

Currently in development (prototype stage). Pending:

- Runtime graphs
- Beamshots and candela measurements
- Hardening notes
