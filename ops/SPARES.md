# SPARES.md

**Path:** `ops/SPARES.md`  
**Purpose:** TFU's spare part policy.  
Yes, we include goodies. Yes, sometimes it’s just an O-ring.

---

## Baseline Spares

Every TFU light includes:
- (1) Body-sized O-ring (matched to host diameter)  
- (1) TFU QR card (serial + docs link)  
- (1) TFU sticker (for morale and identification)

## Model-Specific Spares

| Model | Included Spares | Notes |
|:------|:----------------|:------|
| **TFU-E0** | None | Integrated USB-C charging cell — fully turnkey. |
| **TFU-E1** | (1) Body O-ring | Boost driver, sealed head — no user-serviceable parts required. |
| **TFU-E2** | (1) Body O-ring<br>(1) Kai reverse clicky w/ bypass<br>(1) Kai 3-in-1 TIR (flat optic) | Switch and optic variability justify full spare set. |
| **TFU-E3** | (2) T-series O-rings (body + tail) | Compact 14500 build — includes additional seal. |
| **TFU-F1** | (1) Body O-ring<br>(1) Stock OP reflector<br>(1) Optional 30° matte TIR optic | Enables swap between 15° bead (standard), 30° matte (wide), or reflector configuration for beam preference. |  
| **TFU-F2** | (1) Body O-ring | Standard field build — minimal service parts. |
| **TFU-F3** | (1) Body O-ring | Field mule — no optic swap, all function. |
| **TFU-T1** | (1) Body O-ring<br>(1) Shaved boot (forward clicky) | Maintains switch performance under hard use. |
| **TFU-Custom / Proto** | As built | Refer to serialized documentation. |

## Optional / Situational Spares

| Spare | When Included | Rationale |
|:------|:---------------|:-----------|
| **Custom clip bolt** | When non-standard TFU hardware used | Avoids downtime if user loses hardware. |
| **Shaved boot** | Forward clicky builds | Keeps action smooth after extended use. |
| **Switch assembly** | Known host stress points (Kai, etc.) | Enables quick repair without full teardown. |

## Notes

- O-rings are consumables — TFU ships greased; maintain with Super Lube or equivalent.  
- Extras are intentional. If it’s in the box, it’s there for a reason.  
- F3 users: no condom included. You’re already the flex.
