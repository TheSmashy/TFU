## Overview

Single-emitter B35AM build optimized for high-CRI, neutral-white utility. Balanced between throw and flood using an OP reflector — tuned for field tasks, work benches, and real-world runtime.

> When you need a light that isn’t a stunt, but still flexes on Brice — the TFU-F2 is the tool.

## At a Glance

- **Emitter:** Nichia B35AM, 5000K, high CRI  
- **Driver:** 6V 2A boost, Mode Group 10 (1–10–35–100%)  
- **Switch:** Forward clicky with mode memory  
- **Cell:** 18650 (recommend Molicel M35A)  
- **Optic:** OP reflector, glass lens  

| Mode  | % Output | Lumens | Runtime (est., M35A) |
|-------|----------|--------|----------------------|
| Low   | 1%       | ~12    | 75–90h               |
| Med1  | 10%      | ~150   | 8–10h                |
| Med2  | 35%      | ~500   | 2.5–3h               |
| High  | 100%     | ~1000  | 45–55min             |

*Estimates vary by cell condition and use.*  
*Turbo (100%) is best used in bursts; ~35% is the real sustained work mode.*

## Quick Start
- Unscrew tailcap, remove DC Fix disk blocking battery and spring  
- Insert charged 18650, positive end toward the head  
- **Forward clicky with memory:**  
  - Half-press = momentary ON  
  - Full click = constant ON  
  - Light resumes in last-used mode (memory enabled)  
- Tap to cycle modes: 1% → 10% → 35% → 100%  
- Lockout: unscrew tailcap 1/4 turn  

## Low Voltage Protection (LVP) Behavior — TFU-F2

The TFU-F2 driver includes built-in **Low Voltage Protection (LVP)** to prevent cell over-discharge.

- **Warning:** At ~**3.0 V under load**, the light will **flash 3×** to signal low voltage.  
- **Cutoff:** At ~**2.8 V**, the driver will shut the light off completely.  
- After rest, the cell may rebound above these values — do not continue use.  

**Operator Guidance**  
- First **3× flash** = **SWAP SOON**.  
- Always recharge/swap the cell before hitting cutoff.  
- Do not attempt to bypass LVP. It preserves both the driver and your cells.

## Build Quality

- Tail spring bypass for max current  
- Loctite 242 on hardware; MX-4 and CS109 thermal management on MCPCB/driver  
- Waterproof and drop-tested  
- Hand-assembled and tuned in the U.S.A.
