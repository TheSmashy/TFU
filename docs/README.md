## 💡 About TFU Lights

**TFU (Tactical Field Use)** flashlights are hand-built, tested, and field-verified for reliability and performance.  
Each model is designed around three principles:

1. **Thermal efficiency** – solid heat paths, real regulation.  
2. **Mechanical integrity** – no loose parts, no shortcuts.  
3. **Electrical reliability** – hardened drivers and clean soldering.

### 📄 Notes

- All TFU lights are compatible with **high-quality lithium-ion cells only** (Samsung, Molicel, Vapcell).  
- Always follow the battery recommendations in your specific product guide.  
- Mode settings and driver behavior differ between 14500 and larger-cell models.
