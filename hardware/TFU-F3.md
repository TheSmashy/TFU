# TFU-F3

**Series:** F (Field)  
**Host:** Convoy S16  
**Colorway:** Black and grey  

The TFU-F3 is a high-output field/work light built on the robust Convoy S16 platform and configured as a mule for maximum flood and situational awareness. Designed for sustained high-CRI output in open or enclosed work areas where beam discipline is not a priority. Built and tested in the U.S., the F3 is the first Field series model to reach production — F1 and F2 remain in development.

## Role & Deployment

The TFU-F3 is intended for **field tasks, workspace lighting, and inspection** where maximum area coverage and color accuracy are more important than throw or beam discipline. The 4500 K quad mule configuration renders colors accurately and reduces eye strain, making it ideal for prolonged use in dynamic environments. Not intended for low-signature or tactical operations.
