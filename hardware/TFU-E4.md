# TFU-E4

**Series:** E (Everyday / EDC)  
**Model:** TFU-E4  
**Role:** Compact EDC / task light (field-grade, high-CRI)  
**Status:** Active build

---

## Overview

The **TFU-E4** is a compact EDC / task light built on the **Convoy S3** platform in an **18350** configuration.

Using the S3’s integrated internal shelf and steel bezel, the E4 is designed as a durable, refined beam tool rather than a novelty pocket light. The combination of a **Nichia 519A 5000 K**, ring gasket, **OP reflector**, black lens O-ring, and **AR glass** produces a smooth, consistent hotspot with very even flood and no distracting artifacts.

A **5 A buck driver**, secured with a **Loctite-treated brass retaining ring**, provides stable regulation and predictable output. Both the tail spring and driver springs are bypassed with **22 AWG silicone-insulated wire** for reduced resistance and improved reliability.

The result is a compact light that heats quickly, sheds heat efficiently, and can reasonably be considered **field-grade** while remaining true EDC size.

Colorway is **black / sterile** with a **stonewashed low-profile deep-carry clip** and no external branding.

## Beam Profile

The E4 is tuned for **clean task lighting**, not exaggerated throw or flood.

- **Hotspot:** Smooth, round, and well-defined  
- **Spill:** Even and usable with no sharp cutoff  
- **Artifacts:** None visible in normal use  
- **Character:** Neutral, practical, inspection-friendly

The **519A 5000 K** is intentionally selected for **PID, technical inspection, and equipment work**, where neutral color rendering and clarity matter more than warmth or tint character.

## Mode Behavior (Group 10)

| Mode | Output Character | Practical Use |
|---|---|---|
| **1 %** | Very low, stable | Reading, map work, dark-adapted navigation |
| **10 %** | Comfortable indoor output | Room navigation, vehicle or gear inspection |
| **35 %** | Bright, sustained | Outdoor spotting, trail use, general task work |
| **100 %** | Maximum output | Outdoor use to ~100 m (est.) |

- **Memory:** Disabled  
- **Strobe / SOS:** Disabled

## Thermal & Regulation Behavior

- Integrated S3 shelf provides fast heat transfer from MCPCB to body  
- Light **heats quickly**, then sheds heat predictably  
- Buck driver maintains stable output without erratic step-downs  
- Suitable for repeated high-output bursts in real use

This is not a shelf-queen build — it is intended to be carried, used, and trusted.

## Electrical & Mechanical Build Notes

- **Driver retention:** Brass retaining ring secured with **Loctite 242**  
- **Spring bypasses:** Tail and driver springs bypassed with **22 AWG silicone wire**  
- **Switch:** Reverse clicky for predictable mode changes  
- **Bezel:** Steel, protects lens during hard use  
- **Clip:** Low-profile, deep-carry, stonewashed hardware

## Runtime Estimates  
*519A • 5 A Buck • Vapcell M11v2 (18350, ~1100 mAh)*

> These runtimes are **conservative real-world estimates**, not lab figures.  
> Actual results will vary with ambient temperature and airflow.

| Mode | Output | Estimated Runtime |
|---|---:|---:|
| **1 %** | ~5–10 lm | ~40–50 hours |
| **10 %** | ~60–80 lm | ~8–10 hours |
| **35 %** | ~250–300 lm | ~2.5–3 hours |
| **100 %** | ~700–800 lm | ~45–60 minutes (thermally limited) |

- Regulation remains stable until thermal limits are reached  
- No sudden output cliffs or unsafe thermal behavior observed
