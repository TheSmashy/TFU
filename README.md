![TFU Logo](TFU-LOGO.png)

TFU builds high-performance, hand-assembled flashlights for real-world use â€” tested, hardened, and field-ready.

**TFU** is a hardâ€‘use custom flashlight brand. Each light is handâ€‘made in the USA using highâ€‘quality Convoy components and tuned by hand for reliability, function and realâ€‘world durability. Our mission is to provide serious usersâ€”adventurers, first responders, and field professionalsâ€”with dependable lighting tools they can trust in any situation.

## About

TFU combines premium materials with craftsmanship to produce flashlights that stand up to hard use. We source Convoy parts for their proven performance and build each light by hand, ensuring tight tolerances and careful assembly. Every light is tested and tuned for:

- **Reliability** â€“ consistent output and longâ€‘term durability.
- **Function** â€“ intuitive controls and useful beam profiles.
- **Field use** â€“ rugged construction to withstand demanding environments.
