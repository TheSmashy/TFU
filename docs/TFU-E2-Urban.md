# Welcome to Your TFU-E2 Urban

**Welcome to TFU — Real Gear for Hard Use**  
**TFU-E2 Urban — Warm, High-CRI Urban & Interior Utility Light**

---

## Overview

The **TFU-E2 Urban** is the urban/interior specialist of the E-Series.  
Built around a **single Nichia 519A 3500K emitter**, a **5 A buck driver**, and a **15° bead TIR**, the Urban is engineered to excel in enclosed environments filled with walls, ceilings, mechanical spaces, and reflective surfaces.

This variant removes the front glass for maximum optical efficiency and uses bypassed springs and driver leads for clean, consistent output on all modes.

**Primary mission:** Indoor/urban navigation, mechanical work, and close-range tasks where high CRI, warm tint, and zero glare matter more than sheer output.

### Estimated Output and Runtime

| Mode   | % Output | Lumens (est.) | Runtime (est., 30Q) |
|--------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Low    | 1 %       | ~10–12 lm      | 5–6 days continuous  |
| Med 1  | 10 %      | ~120–150 lm    | 10–12 hr             |
| Med 2  | 35 %      | ~380–450 lm    | 3.5–4.5 hr           |
| High   | 100 %     | ~950–1050 lm (initial) → ~850 lm sustained | 30–35 min regulated → ~45–50 min total |

*Values based on TFU bench runs using MX-4 and bypassed hardware. Real-world performance varies with temperature and cell condition.*

## Electrical / Optical Data

### Emitter
- Nichia 519A  
- 3500 K, CRI 90+ (R9080)  
- Warm neutral with a slight rosy bias  
- Excellent indoor color rendering

### Optic
- Convoy 15° bead TIR  
- Smooth, soft flood with a crisp usable core  
- Zero rings or artifacts  
- Ideal for interior tasks and close-range work

### Driver
- 5 A constant-current buck  
- Clean regulation down to ~3.0 V  
- No PWM  
- Bypassed leads for reduced resistance

### Spring / Bypass Work
- **Tail spring bypassed** (braided copper)  
- **Driver bypass applied**  
- Lower resistance, better stability, faster mode-change recovery

### Lens
- **None (open-optic)**  
- +5–7% optical efficiency  
- Reduced glare  
- Optic is mechanically protected by bezel

## Usage Notes

- This is an **urban/interior tool**, not a thrower.  
- 3500 K high-CRI reduces eye strain and improves material identification.  
- 10–35 % are ideal for 95% of indoor tasks.  
- 100 % is best in short bursts indoors; excellent outdoors.  
- No front glass = higher efficiency and fewer reflections.
