**Welcome to TFU – Real Gear for Hard Use**  
**TFU-E2 – Compact Triple-Emitter EDC Platform**

---

## Overview

The **TFU-E2** is a compact, high-output, high-CRI EDC platform built around a **triple Nichia array** and a **5 A regulated buck driver**.  
It is designed as a premium everyday tool for technicians, field users, and anyone who values clean color rendering and reliable, predictable output.

Every TFU-E2 is hand-assembled, thermally tuned, and QC’d at the Boathouse.

_Primary mission:_ A compact triple with elite tint, smooth beam, and real-work reliability.

## Emitter Options

The TFU-E2 comes in two configurations. Both are excellent — choose based on preference:

### **TFU-E2 / 219BT (4500 K, CRI90+)**  
- True-to-life tint  
- Beautiful rosy-neutral character  
- Exceptional color rendering indoors and outdoors  
- The “photographer’s pick”

### **TFU-E2 / 219F (5000 K, CRI90+)**  
- Clean, honest, neutral-white appearance  
- Slightly cooler without going blue  
- Excellent task/inspection light  
- The “technician’s pick”

Both use **Kai’s 20 mm MCPCBs** and **Carclo 10511 optics** for a smooth, wide, usable beam.

## Operating Tips

- Medium and high modes give best output/runtimes.  
- Triples run warm — normal behavior.  
- Turbo is for short bursts; stepdowns are expected.  
- Use only high-quality 18650 cells.  
- Store at ~3.7–3.8 V when not in active rotation.

---

## Battery Recommendations

- **Samsung 30Q** – High output  
- **Molicel M35A** – Long runtime  

Avoid low-quality cells — triples pull honest current.
