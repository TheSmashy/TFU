# TFU-T1 Hardening List

## Baseline (Convoy Stock)
- Deep carry clip with stock screws (torques poorly, not solid).
- No spring bypass.
- Forward clicky: “instant on” feel, but stock electrical path.
- Stock assembly with factory thermal paste, retaining rings, bezel, etc.

## Hardening Mods
- **Clip Hardware:** Swap to upgraded “good hardware” for a solid, no-wobble mount.  
- **Spring Bypass:** Added for lower resistance and harder punch on activation.  
- **Head End Threads:** MX-4 thermal paste for improved heat transfer and service longevity.  
- **Driver Retention:** Check for room to glue down; secure with thermal adhesive if possible.  
- **MCPCB Contact:** Reseat with MX-4; inspect for voids or gaps.  
- **Bezel:** Verify torque and re-seat; apply Loctite 242 to prevent loosening.  
- **Retaining Rings:** Loctite 242 on driver and tail retaining rings for serviceable hardening.  
- **Switch Assembly:** Inspect forward clicky; confirm crisp momentary and no mush.  

## Status
Hardened prototype in progress.  
Next steps: runtime test, thermal curve, candela measurement, QA after mods.
