## Mission Profile

Ultra-compact 14500 tactical light engineered for high-output, low-signature operation.  
Purpose-built for controlled environments, admin pouches, or EDC deployment where reliability and lumen density outweigh runtime.  
Neutral-white accuracy, field-ready hardening, and no wasted grams — this is TFU minimalism taken to the edge.

## Performance (Shipping — Mode Group 8, F12 1250 mAh)

| Parameter | Estimate |
|------------|-----------|
| **High (50 %)** | ≈ 650–750 lm at turn-on (@ ~2.45 A tail draw) |
| **Medium (20 %)** | ≈ 230–270 lm optimized for runtime |
| **Low (1 %)** | ~12–20 lm — map reading / close work, not “covert” |
| **CCT / CRI** | 5000 K neutral white / CRI 90+ |
| **Runtime (F12 1250 mAh)** | ≈ 30–32 min @ 50 %  /  ≈ 2 h @ 20 %  /  ≈ 30–40 h @ 1 % |
| **Thermal Regulation** | Active buck control; case gets hot under sustained high |

## Performance (Group 5 — 1 / 20 / 100 %, Vapcell H10)

Configured for maximum violence of action with a true high-drain cell.

| Parameter | Estimate |
|------------|-----------|
| **High (100 %)** | ≈ 1100–1300 lm burst at turn-on (@ ~4.8–5.0 A tail draw, fresh H10) |
| **Medium (20 %)** | ≈ 230–270 lm, similar output to Group 8 medium |
| **Low (1 %)** | ~12–20 lm — navigation / admin light |
| **Runtime (H10 ≈1000 mAh)** | ≈ 10–12 min @ 100 % (to significant step-down / sag)  /  ≈ 50–60 min @ 20 %  /  ≈ 15–20 h @ 1 % |
| **Thermal Behavior** | Body becomes very hot in under a minute at 100 %; treat as a controlled-burst mode only |

> **Group 5 Use Case:**  
> H10 + Group 5 is a “pocket flash-bang” profile — short, decisive bursts at 100 % with 20 % as a sustainable work level and 1 % for navigation.

## Beamshot

![TFU-T2 5 m Garage Beamshot](../Assets/TFU-T2-5000K-5M-Garage.jpg)

> **Beamshot — TFU-T2 @ 5 m (High / 100 %)**  
> Captured using fixed exposure and white balance for accurate color rendering.  
> The 519A 5000 K emitter delivers a tight, neutral hotspot with smooth spill and true-to-life color fidelity.  
> Balanced peripheral illumination makes the T2 useful for both pinpoint ID and short-range tasks.

## TFU Assembly Notes

- MCPCB seated with razor-thin MX-4 film; leads tinned, centered, and Kapton-isolated.  
- Driver anchored with four CS109 points; Loctite 242 on retainer ring.  
- Tail spring bypassed with 22 AWG silicone; zero flux residue.  
- Pill threads lightly wetted with CS109 to improve conduction.  
- Lens and bezel threads lubed with Super Lube PTFE.  
- 24 h minimum cure before testing.  
- Passed 1 m drop and rain-spray validation.

## Tactical Mode Doctrine

Shipping in **Mode Group 8 (1 / 20 / 50 %)** intentionally limits peak output to a safer, more practical envelope while retaining decisive escalation.

- **1 %** — low-impact navigation and quiet movement  
- **20 %** — admin tasks, map work, and close-range problem-solving  
- **50 %** — rapid escalation for target ID and short, high-output bursts    

For users who understand the trade-offs, **Group 5 (1 / 20 / 100 %)** with an **H10** unlocks full driver output:

- **1 %** — same low floor as Group 8  
- **20 %** — general work and search level  
- **100 %** — maximum punch; treat as a 10–15 s burst mode with enforced cool-down

**Thermal Guidance (Group 5 / H10):**  
At 100 % the aluminum chassis will reach “too hot to hold” quickly. Keep continuous full-power bursts to ≈ 10–15 s followed by ≥ 90 s cool-down. This preserves emitter life and keeps the cell out of abuse territory.

> *Low signature. Immediate escalation. Absolute control.*

## TFU Evaluation

> *A pocket-sized E1 with an anger problem.*  
> Tiny footprint, surgical color rendering, and enough punch to clear a room.  
> Built for those who don’t ask their gear — they command it.
