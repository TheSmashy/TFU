# TFU-F3 “Bravo” — Directed Mule Flood Light

**Model:** TFU-F3B
**Series:** F-Series (Field / Flood)  
**Host:** Convoy S16 (21700 platform)  
**Type:** High-CRI Directed Mule / Task Flood  
**Release:** Founder’s Edition — October 2025

## Overview

The **TFU-F3 Bravo** is the warm-tint, ultra-high-CRI variant of the F3 platform — a regulated quad-emitter directed mule designed for wide-area, natural flood illumination.  
It runs a **2S2P Nichia 219B SW45K 4500 K array** on a copper MCPCB, driven by a **6 V 3 A buck driver** for smooth, stable output.  
The S16 head’s natural cavity produces a forward-biased mule beam: broad, even, and color-true.

This is not a lumen-chasing light — it’s controlled, accurate floodlighting for real work.

## Character & Purpose

> **“The Bravo doesn’t chase throw — it owns the room.”**

The Bravo variant is the F3’s warm-tint reference model:  
a stable, regulated quad mule that renders surfaces with cinematic accuracy.  

Ideal for:

- field techs  
- inspection work  
- makers and engineers  
- indoor / enclosed environments  
- any task requiring accurate color and wide, even spill
