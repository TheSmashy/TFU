# TFU-T2 — *Pocket Banger*

**Series:** T (Tactical)  
**Model:** TFU-T2  
---

## Mission Profile

Ultra-compact 14500 tactical light engineered for high-output, low-signature operation.  
Purpose-built for controlled environments, admin pouches, or EDC deployment where reliability and lumen density outweigh runtime.  
Neutral-white accuracy, field-ready hardening, and no wasted grams — this is TFU minimalism taken to the edge.

## TFU Assembly Notes

- MCPCB seated with **razor-thin MX-4** film; leads tinned, centered, and Kapton-isolated.  
- Driver anchored with **four CS109 points**, Loctite 242 on retainer ring.  
- Tail spring **bypassed with 22 AWG silicone**, zero flux residue.  
- Pill threads lightly wetted with CS109 to improve conduction.  
- Lens and bezel threads lubed with **Super Lube PTFE**.  
- 24 h minimum cure before testing.  
- Passed **1 m drop** and **rain spray** validation.

### Tactical Mode Doctrine

The TFU-T2 is tuned for **decisive activation under stress** — no scrolling, no hesitation.  
**Group 10 (20 % / 100 %) with memory ON** provides disciplined control and immediate escalation:

- **20 % Mode** — low-visibility navigation, map work, and admin tasks with extended runtime.  
- **100 % Mode** — instant access to full 5 A drive for search, threat ID, or signal burst.  
- **Memory ON** — pre-stage for mission intent; light always starts where you left it.

At 5 A drive, the aluminum chassis becomes **uncomfortably hot within 60–90 s**.  
For operator safety and emitter longevity, TFU limits continuous turbo to **≤ 45 s**, followed by **≥ 90 s cool-down.**

This configuration reflects TFU’s core field ethos:  
> *Low signature. Immediate escalation. Absolute control.*

## TFU Evaluation

> *A pocket-sized E1 with an anger problem.*  
> Tiny footprint, surgical color rendering, and enough punch to clear a room.  
> Built for those who don’t ask their gear — they command it.
