# TFU Brand Lights

![TFU Logo](TFU-LOGO.png)

**TFU** is a hard‑use custom flashlight brand. Each light is hand‑made in the USA using high‑quality Convoy components and tuned by hand for reliability, function and real‑world durability. Our mission is to provide serious users—adventurers, first responders, and field professionals—with dependable lighting tools they can trust in any situation.

## About

TFU combines premium materials with craftsmanship to produce flashlights that stand up to hard use. We source Convoy parts for their proven performance and build each light by hand, ensuring tight tolerances and careful assembly. Every light is tested and tuned for:

- **Reliability** – consistent output and long‑term durability.
- **Function** – intuitive controls and useful beam profiles.
- **Field use** – rugged construction to withstand demanding environments.
