# TFU-E0 Pocket Series (Concept Hardware Sheet)

## Overview
The **TFU-E0** is the smallest entry in the TFU Everyday Carry (E-series) lineup. Built on the Convoy T5 host, it is designed as a compact, reliable, and gift-ready EDC light that balances everyday practicality with TFU’s hardened ethos. 

A “gateway” light into the TFU brand: small enough to pocket, simple enough for anyone to use, and tough enough to carry TFU’s seal of reliability.

## Host & Form Factor
- **Base:** Convoy T5 host
- **Cell:** 14500, USB-C rechargeable (Acebeam protected recommended)
- **Form:** Slim pocket EDC, one-hand operation
- **UI:** Tail clicky, simple mode set

---

## Optics & Output
- **Optic:** Upgraded 17 mm TIR, **30° bead** (default)
- **Output (estimates):** 600–800 lm peak depending on emitter choice
- **Beam Profile:** Defined hotspot with usable spill (no “room flood” effect)

---

## Emitter Options
1. **Nichia 519A 4500K CRI90**
   - High-CRI, balanced tint for everyday utility
   - Works cleanly with 30° bead TIR

2. **Luminus SST-20-DR 660nm (Deep Red)**
   - Specialized for signaling, preserving night vision
   - Small die pairs well with 30° bead TIR

---

## Electronics & Hardening
- **Driver:** Stock driver or tuned linear (TBD)
- **Spring:** Tail spring bypass for efficiency and reliability
- **Thermal:** Hardened with MX-4 and seating improvements
- **QC:** Each light tested for beam profile, thermal path, and runtime

---

## Power System
- **Cells:** Acebeam USB-C rechargeable 14500 (bulk-sourced)
- **Charging:** USB-C direct, safe, standardized
- **Runtime:** Optimized for practical EDC cycles (multi-hour low, strong high)

---

## Mission Fit
- **Everyday Carry:** Pocketable, reliable, no external charger needed
- **Gift-Ready:** Turnkey package with cell included, USB-C charging
- **Entry-Level TFU:** Smallest, simplest TFU light — proof of ethos in miniature

---

## Concept Tagline
**TFU-E0 — The smallest hard-use light. Everyday toughness, pocket size.**

---

## Next Steps (Build & Test)
- Source bulk Acebeam cells → validate compatibility
- Test TIR upgrades (30° bead confirmed, matte variant TBD)
- Run emitter swaps (519A 4500K, SST-20-DR 660nm)
- Spring bypass prototype
- Capture runtime/thermal data
- Finalize UI and mode groups
