# TFU-E2

**Series:** E (Everyday / EDC)  
**Host:** Convoy S2 (including sterile hosts observed in early builds)  
**Colorway:** Black and grey  

The TFU-E2 is a compact, high-CRI triple emitter light built on the proven Convoy S2 platform. Designed for everyday carry and practical utility, the E2 prioritizes beam quality, color accuracy, and controlled output over raw lumens. All builds are hand-assembled, thermally tuned, and electrically hardened to meet TFU standards.

**Status:** In Development  
_Provisional spec — subject to refinement pending full runtime and thermal testing._

## Specifications (Mk0 Baseline)

- **Cell size:** 18650  
- **Recommended cell:** Samsung 30Q (baseline) or Molicel M35A (runtime focus)  
- **Driver:** 5 A Buck (12-group UI) with 17–22 mm adaptor  
- **Emitter:** Triple Nichia 219BT (4500 K, 90 CRI)

- **Impact resistance:** 1 m drop tested  
- **Electrical mod:** Tail spring bypass (22 AWG), tight thermal and electrical tolerances  

## Prototype Variants

- **TFU-E2 mk0A (18650 Standard):** Sterile S2 host, Samsung 30Q cell, baseline build.  
- **TFU-E2 mk0B (18350 Compact):** Sterile S2 host + black 18350 tube, Vapcell M11v2 cell, compact EDC variant.  

Both share the same optic, driver, and emitter setup, allowing for direct runtime and thermal comparison between full-length and compact configurations.

## Role & Deployment

The TFU-E2 is designed for **EDC, inspection, and close-range task lighting** where beam fidelity and neutral color temperature are key. With its 4500 K triple-emitter array and regulated 5 A buck driver, the E2 delivers a clean, color-accurate beam suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. The low-profile S2 host offers a slim profile without compromising output, while the option to swap between 18650 and 18350 formats gives flexibility between runtime and compactness.

Ideal for:
- Tradespeople and technicians  
- EDC enthusiasts  
- Low-signature, high-fidelity environments  

## Runtime & Thermal Performance

![TFU-E2 runtime graph placeholder](../Assets/TFU-E2-Runtime-Graph.jpg)  
*Placeholder — runtime and thermal data will be added after TEST-O-MATIC-PI benchmarking.*

**Test parameters (planned):**  
- Cells: Samsung 30Q (mk0A), Vapcell M11v2 (mk0B)  
- Mode: 100 % (Mode Group 2)  
- Ambient: *TBD* °C  
- Distance to lux sensor: *TBD* m  
- Logging interval: *TBD* seconds  

## Tuning and Options

All TFU-E2 builds feature precision thermal stacking using punched copper foil, tuned driver behavior, and sealed pill cavity construction. Custom emitter bins, optic swaps (10508/10507), or body color variants may be available in future runs. Contact TFU for interest in additional E2 units or EDC kits.
