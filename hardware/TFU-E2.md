# TFU-E2

**Series:** E (Everyday / EDC)  
**Host:** Convoy S2  
**Colorway:** Black and grey  

The TFU-E2 is a compact, high-CRI triple emitter light built on the proven Convoy S2 platform. Designed for everyday carry and practical utility, the E2 prioritizes beam quality, color accuracy, and controlled output over raw lumens. All builds are hand-assembled, thermally tuned, and electrically hardened to meet TFU standards.

**Status:** In Development  
_Provisional spec — subject to refinement pending full runtime and thermal testing._

## Role & Deployment

The TFU-E2 is designed for **EDC, inspection, and close-range task lighting** where beam fidelity and neutral color temperature are key. With its 4500 K triple-emitter array and regulated 5 A buck driver, the E2 delivers a clean, color-accurate beam suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. The low-profile S2 host and 18650 format offer a slim profile without compromising runtime or output.

Ideal for:
- Tradespeople and technicians
- EDC enthusiasts
- Low-signature, high-fidelity environments

## Runtime & Thermal Performance

*Placeholder — runtime and thermal data will be added after TEST-O-MATIC-PI benchmarking.*

**Test parameters (planned):**  
- Cell: Samsung 30Q, fully charged at 4.20 V  
- Mode: 100 % (Mode Group 2)  
- Ambient: *TBD* °C  
- Distance to lux sensor: *TBD* m  
- Logging interval: *TBD* seconds

## Tuning and Options

All TFU-E2 builds feature precision thermal stacking using punched copper foil, tuned driver behavior, and sealed pill cavity construction. Custom emitter bins, optic swaps (10508/10507), or body color variants may be available in future runs. Contact TFU for interest in additional E2 units or EDC kits.
