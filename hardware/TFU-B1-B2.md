## Prototype Configurations

### TFU-B1 “Beacon Blue”
- **Host:** Shipping light (Convoy-style base, experimental)
- **Emitter:** Osram Blue (high-intensity)
- **Driver:** 7135×5 linear driver (~1.75A)
- **Modes:** Strobe / SOS / High / Med / Low
- **Optics:** 10° Flat TIR (narrow beam)
- **Cell:** Samsung 35E (3500mAh, high-capacity)
- **Switch/UI:** Tail switch with direct access to mode cycle
- **Accessories:** Clip-on diffuser, electrical tape for securing light to poles or fixed surfaces

### TFU-B2 “Beacon Red” (Planned)
- **Host:** Same platform as B1 (experimental)
- **Emitter:** Osram Red (deep red)
- **Driver:** 7135×5 linear driver (~1.75A)
- **Modes:** Strobe / SOS / High / Med / Low

## Beacon Identity

- **High Visibility Colors:** Blue for piercing, eye-catching contrast; Red for universal distress/night-vision compatibility.
- **Extended Runtime:** 35E cell matched to low-current driver for day+ operation.
- **Simple, Direct UI:** Multiple modes available, but mission is SOS/strobe for emergency visibility.
- **Portability & Mounting:** Compact host, diffuser, and ability to secure light to poles/objects expands use cases.
- **Hardened:** TFU standards applied — thermal paste, thread lubrication, driver/MCPCB secured, retaining rings torqued and Loctited.

## Test & Evaluation Notes

- **Runtime:** Continuous SOS runtime with 35E cell, confirm minimum 24h.
- **Beam Profile:** Evaluate visibility at distance and through haze/fog.
- **Durability:** Drop and water submersion tests; confirm waterproofing.
- **Usability:** Stress test SOS, diffuser use, and mounting tape in dark/cold/wet conditions.

## Availability

- **Cells Included:** Available with Samsung 35E cells, plus optional spare cells.
- **Field Cases:** Cells offered in single or double rugged cases suitable for field use (not standard battery sleeves).
- **Host Status:** Host type remains experimental as we refine for the best tool at the lowest cost with uncompromising quality.

## Status

- **TFU-B1 (Blue):** Prototype complete, pending TFU hardening.
- **TFU-B2 (Red):** Mk I Mod 0 planned, sourcing emitter/host.
