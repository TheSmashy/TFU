# Lifetime Warranty – Workmanship & Materials

Stuff breaks. Stories happen. I’ll stand behind the build.  

Your TFU light is covered for life (original owner) against defects in **workmanship** and **materials**. If it fails in normal use, I’ll make it right.  

---

## What’s Not Covered
- Normal wear and tear  
- Cosmetic blemishes  
- Damage from gross abuse or unauthorized mods  

---

## If Something Goes Wrong
Contact me with your serial/model number and a short description. I’ll sort it with **repair**, **replacement**, or **fair-cost service**.  
Most repairs are handled within 14 days of receipt.  

---

## If You Did Something Wild
Fell out of a helicopter? Run over by a truck? Still reach out.  
At minimum you’ll get a **discounted repair** or a **break on a new light** — especially if the story’s good.
