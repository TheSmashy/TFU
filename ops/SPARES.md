# TFU Spare Policy

**Revision:** 2025-10-17  
**Purpose:** Defines standard spare parts included with each TFU light to ensure maintainability, modularity, and user serviceability in the field.

---

## Baseline Spares

All TFU lights include:
- (1) Body-sized O-ring, matched to the host diameter  
- (1) QR documentation card with serial number and GitHub link  
- (1) TFU-approved sticker (because morale matters)

## Model-Specific Spares

| Model | Included Spares | Notes |
|:------|:----------------|:------|
| **TFU-E0** | None (integrated USB-C cell) | Designed as a turnkey light. No external parts needed. |
| **TFU-E1** | (1) Body O-ring | Boost-driven B35AM light; no field-replaceable parts required. |
| **TFU-E2** | (1) Body O-ring<br>(1) Kai reverse clicky w/ bypass<br>(1) Kai 3-in-1 TIR optic (flat) | Switch provided due to known Kai variability. Alternate TIR supplied for beam tuning. |
| **TFU-E3** | (2) T-series O-rings (body + tail) | For maintaining seal integrity on compact 14500 body. |
| **TFU-F1** | (1) Body O-ring<br>(1) Stock OP reflector | Provides user option to revert from bead optic to reflector configuration. |
| **TFU-F2** | (1) Body O-ring | Field-use build; standard issue. |
| **TFU-F3** | (1) Body O-ring | Field mule. No spare optics—just light discipline and common sense. |
| **TFU-T1** | (1) Body O-ring<br>(1) Shaved boot (forward clicky) | Boot provided for field maintenance of switch action. |
| **TFU-Custom / Proto** | As-built | Refer to internal build notes or serialized documentation. |

## Optional / Situational Spares

| Spare | When Included | Rationale |
|:------|:---------------|:-----------|
| **Custom clip bolt** | When non-standard TFU hardware used | Prevents downtime if user loses bolt in field. |
| **Shaved boot (forward clicky)** | For all F/T series with forward clickies | Maintains smooth actuation after heavy use. |
| **Switch assembly** | Only when known stress point exists (e.g., Kai host) | Enables quick field repair without desoldering. |

## Notes

- O-rings are considered consumables — TFU ships fresh, but always grease with Super Lube or equivalent.  
- If your light includes something extra (reflector, TIR, switch), that’s intentional.  
- If your light includes *nothing*, that’s also intentional. TFU builds are field-serviceable, not swag boxes.  
- F3 owners: no condoms in the kit. You already pulled enough.
