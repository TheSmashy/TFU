**Welcome to TFU – Real Gear for Hard Use**  
**TFU-E2 Classic – Premium Triple 519A Workhorse**

---

## Overview

The **TFU-E2 Classic** is the production baseline triple for TFU.

Built around **three Nichia 519A 5000K emitters**, a **regulated 5A buck driver**, and the proven **Convoy S2 platform**, the Classic is tuned for balance — output, thermals, beam control, and long service life.

This is the E2 most people should buy.

_Primary mission:_ A durable, high-CRI work light with predictable behavior and zero drama.

Every unit is hand-assembled, thermally tuned, electrically verified, and QC’d at the Boathouse.

## What Makes It “Classic”

- Triple **Nichia 519A 5000K (R9080)**
- **Carclo 10508 optic** (defined hotspot, smooth spill)
- **5A regulated buck driver**
- **Aluminum thermal spacer** for consistent, repeatable heat behavior
- Sterile S2 host with AR glass
- TFU clip and black lens o-ring refinement

The Classic is not experimental.  
It is standardized, repeatable, and production-stable.

## At a Glance

- **Emitter:** Triple Nichia 519A 5000K (CRI 90+)
- **Optic:** Carclo 10508
- **Driver:** 5A regulated buck
- **Mode Group:** 1% → 10% → 35% → 100%
- **Memory:** OFF
- **Host:** Convoy S2 (black, AR glass)
- **Battery:** 18650
- **Beam:** Neutral hotspot, soft spill, no artifacts
- **Thermals:** Controlled rise, stable regulation

---

## Performance Notes (Realistic Use)

- **100%:** High output burst mode. Expect warmth. Designed for short high-demand tasks.
- **35%:** Primary sustained working mode.
- **10%:** Indoor tasks, inspection, admin work.
- **1%:** Reading, night vision preservation, extended runtime.

Triples generate heat honestly.  
The aluminum spacer allows quicker heat shedding and predictable ramp.

This light is tuned to behave — not surprise you.

## Battery Recommendations

- **Samsung 30Q** – Peak output bias  
- **Molicel M35A** – Runtime bias  

Store cells at **3.7–3.8 V** when not in rotation.  
Use only quality cells from trusted vendors.

---

## Build Standards

Each TFU-E2 Classic receives:

- Thin, even MX-4 thermal interface
- Properly seated MCPCB with flush optic stack
- Driver secured and verified
- Dual spring bypass (low resistance, stable delivery)
- Thread cleaning and lubrication
- Loctite on retaining hardware
- Internal serialized label
- QC current verification on all modes
- 15-minute 100% thermal validation

This is not a parts bin triple.

It is assembled deliberately, with repeatability in mind.

---

## Operating Guidance

- Medium modes provide best efficiency.
- High is for burst demand.
- Stepdowns are normal under thermal load.
- Avoid storing fully charged for long periods.
- Do not mix cells of unknown history.
