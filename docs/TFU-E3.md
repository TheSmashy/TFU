**Welcome to TFU â€“ Real Gear for Hard Use**  
**TFU-E3 â€“ Compact Triple Field Light**

---

## Overview

The **TFU-E3** is a compact, high-output EDC light built for field use and inspection work.  
Itâ€™s engineered around a **triple Nichia 519A** array and a **5 A buck driver**, delivering stable, high-CRI performance in a small form factor.  
Ideal for technicians, responders, and anyone needing clean, bright light in a pocketable 14500-class host.

_Primary mission:_ High-CRI triple with balanced flood and runtime in a 14500 platform.  
Designed for sustained regulation, thermal control, and everyday durability.
