**Welcome to TFU â€“ Real gear for hard use**

**TFU-F3 â€“ Field / Flood Utility**

## Overview

Quad-emitter mule configuration for maximum flood and situational awareness. Designed for sustained high-CRI output in open or enclosed work areas where beam discipline is not required. Built for real-world use with hardened mechanicals and thermal path.

## Mission Profile

Field utility light with sustained output, massive wall of light, and accurate color rendering. Purpose-built for inspection, camp/task lighting, and worksite use. Not intended for covert or tactical applications.
