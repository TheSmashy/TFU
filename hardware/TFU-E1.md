# TFU‑E1

**Series:** E (Everyday Carry)

**Host:** Convoy S2+

**Colorway:** Tan and black

The TFU‑E1 is a compact EDC flashlight built from the rugged Convoy S2+ host and hand‑tuned for serious users who need dependable light.  Built and tested in the U.S., it’s offered in two versions to suit different color temperature preferences:
- **Mk I (3500 K):** Uses a warm-white emitter for natural color rendering and comfortable low-light use.
  - *This warm CCT emitter is good for rain, fog, snow, and dust, and produces a reduced signature.*
- **Mk II (5000 K):** Features a neutral-white emitter for balanced color reproduction and increased brightness.
  - *This neutral CCT is good for technical work, inspection, and more natural color resolution.*

Both versions share the same high‑quality components and are assembled with attention to reliability, function and field use.
