## Design Overview

The **TFU-E2** is a compact, high-CRI triple-emitter light built on the proven Convoy S2+ platform.  
Designed for everyday carry and task lighting, it prioritizes **beam quality, color accuracy, and reliability** over marketing lumen counts.

Every E2 is **hand-assembled, thermally tuned, and electrically hardened** to meet TFU standards for field durability and performance.

## Role & Deployment

The **E2** is optimized for **EDC, inspection, and close-range task lighting**.  
Its 4500 K triple-emitter beam provides neutral, high-fidelity color for indoor and outdoor use, with smooth flood and excellent detail rendering.

**Key use cases:**  
- Field and bench technicians  
- Tradespeople requiring accurate color rendering  
- EDC users valuing low-signature, honest light

## Why 219BT Triple

The 219BT triple configuration was chosen for its *efficiency, fidelity, and character*.  
Running three 219BT emitters at 5 A produces a well-regulated, neutral beam with real endurance in the hand.

**Beam comparisons:**  
- [219B 4500 K](../Assets/TFU-E2-219BT-4500K-219B-4500K-2m-Garage.jpg) â†’ rosy tint, pleasing but niche  
- [519A 4500 K](../Assets/TFU-E2-219BT-4500K-519A-4500K-2m-Garage.jpg) â†’ creamy white, excellent generalist  
- [219BT 4500 K](../Assets/TFU-E2-219BT-4500K-5m-Garage.jpg) â†’ clean neutral white, high contrast, truthful rendering  

> **Doctrine:** *Builds should not only work â€” they should reveal the truth of the light.*

## Clip Specification â€” TFU Doctrine

The E2â€™s clip is a **mission component**, not decoration.

- **Required:** Convoy S21A black oxide clip  
- **Why:**  
  - Wide stance â†’ resists torsion and bending  
  - Robust spring tension â†’ secure retention under movement  
  - Deep carry profile â†’ low signature and comfort  

**Rejected:**  
- Standard S2/M1 clips â†’ weak stance and shift under load  
- Boutique aftermarket â†’ non-mission aligned  

> **Doctrine:** The clip is part of the tool. Simpler is stronger.

## Hardening Notes

**Model:** TFU-E2 (Triple 219BT, Carclo 10511)  
**Driver:** Convoy 5 A linear (Loctite + CS109 bonded)  
**Spacer:** MTN 7 mm copper â€“ drilled and fitted  
**Optic:** Carclo 10511 + 1 mm clear O-ring compression  

![TFU-E2 Core](../Assets/TFU-E2-Core-Build.jpg)

### Mechanical Stack Integrity
- **Driver Retention:** Driver seated with thermal adhesive + Loctite ring to prevent micro-movement and maintain ground continuity.  
- **Optic Compression:** Transparent 1 mm O-ring locks Carclo 10511 without light signature after power-off.  
- **Spacer Fitment:** 7 mm Cu spacer drilled for lead routing; adds thermal mass and height correction.  

### Thermal Path
- **MX-4 (TIM):** Between MCPCB and spacer; non-curing and electrically safe.  
- **CS109 (Adhesive):** Between spacer and pill; bonds mechanically and electrically.  
- **MCPCB Seating:** Triple board clamped flush with zero air gap for direct heat flow to host.  

### Electrical Reliability
- **Emitter Board:** 219BT triple (parallel) reflowed under flux, polarity verified.
- **Driver**: 5A buck with 22 AWG bypass for reduced resistance.
- **Switch:** Convoy reverse clicky + 22 AWG bypass for reduced resistance.  
- **Ground Path:** Spacer bonded to pill; driver secured with adhesive and Loctite for low-impedance continuity.

## Why Harden

TFU lights are **tools, not trophies.**  
Hardening ensures reliability under abuse:

- No floating drivers  
- No rocking MCPCBs  
- No optic shift under compression  
- No thermal bottlenecks  

Every adhesive, spacer, and O-ring choice supports one goal: **a light you can trust in the field.**
